This year, Amazon kicked off its holiday shopping season earlier than ever. The popular online retailer announced\u00a0its\u00a0first wave of Black Friday sales on <span>October 4</span> , with markdowns across all categories. On <span>November 15</span> , the brand announced it will host a 48-hour sale starting at 12:01 a.m. PST\u00a0on\u00a0 <span>Thursday, November 25.\u00a0</span> Amazon also announced a list of its most-loved gifts available right now.\u00a0We expect to see\u00a0even deeper discounts on everything from kitchen essentials and\u00a0electronics to toys and fashion pieces in the coming weeks.\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">What are the best deals from the Amazon Black Friday 2021 sale?\u00a0</p><p>To date, we've seen massive Amazon Black Friday deals on air fryers, headphones, home goods and more\u2014including tons of products from some of our favorite brands, like Apple, KitchenAid, Sony, Bose, iRobot and Shark.</p><p>Every day Amazon adds even more sales to their lineup of Black Friday 2021 deals. Be sure to bookmark this page and check back frequently to scoop the hottest\u00a0Amazon discounts on must-have items this holiday season.\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Are Amazon Black Friday sales available online?\u00a0</p><p>Yes. Amazon Black Friday sales are exclusively available online. There may be some deals that are exclusive to Prime members, but most will be available to all Amazon customers.</p><p>Amazon will also sometimes offer exclusive Alexa deals that can be found by asking your Alexa device, like an Echo dot, for certain sales. In most cases these same deals are available on the main Amazon website as well, but we'll note when that's not the case.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">What's the difference between Amazon Black Friday deals and Amazon Cyber Monday deals?\u00a0</p><p>With Amazon Black Friday deals already here, the early holiday sales double as both Black Friday discounts and pre-Cyber Monday deals. While, technically, Amazon Cyber Monday deals roll out as soon as Black Friday ends on <span>November 26</span> , we expect to see significant overlap in Amazon's roundup of Black Friday and Cyber Monday markdowns. Both waves of holiday deals will be exclusively available online, so be sure to secure your Amazon Prime membership ahead of time to enjoy fast and free shipping.\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Does Amazon have special\u00a0Black Friday deals for Amazon Prime members?\u00a0</p><p>Yes. During the holiday shopping season, Amazon Prime members have early access to select holiday deals and can even earn\u00a0up to 25% back on select Amazon purchases with an Amazon Prime Card and an eligible Prime membership. Meanwhile, Prime members can get their holiday gifts quicker with access to free and fast shipping, with millions of must-have items available for same-day delivery. If you aren't already an Amazon Prime member, don't worry\u2014there's still plenty of time to sign up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\"><span>When does the Amazon Black Friday sale end?</span><span>\u00a0</span> </p><p>The Amazon Black Friday sale ends on <span>November 26</span> , with Amazon Cyber Monday deals rolling out the following day, on <span>November 27</span> . Keep in mind, however, that many of the markdowns included in the Amazon Black Friday sale are one-day deals.\u00a0</p><p>Following the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend of sales, we expect to see discounts on select items throughout the holiday season\u2014however, with shipping delays and stock shortages expected, we recommend shopping early to ensure you get all the holiday gifts on your list this year.\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Shop Amazon Black Friday 2021 deals right now.\u00a0</p><p><span><span>There's more where this deal came from.</span> Sign up for Reviewed's Perks and Rec newsletter and we'll keep 'em coming every Sunday through Friday.</span> </p><p><span>The product experts at <span>Reviewed</span> have all your shopping needs covered.
