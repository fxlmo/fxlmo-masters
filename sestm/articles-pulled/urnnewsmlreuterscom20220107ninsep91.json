During the repowering, nine of those machines were decommissioned and four new ones were installed, while 24 legacy turbines were replaced by new hardware. The upgraded project utilises the latest Vestas technology, Leeward said on Thursday.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>The repowering project will improve the reliability and performance of the wind farm and lower costs related to its operation.
