According to statista.com and eMarketer, 63 percent of online shoppers\u00a0go to Amazon to start searching for products, which we believe will increase brand awareness and customer acquisition.</p>\n<p>\"As the founder of PlantFuel, my mission was simple: to create a new frontier in plant-based supplement initiatives by expanding the current landscape with the ingredient technologies. We are only using the latest, greatest innovations for our wellness platform,\"\u00a0confirms Pyatt. \"Our team of leading physicians and formulators has worked for years to bridge the gap between traditional sports nutrition and plant-based ingredients. Until now, no plant-based products could match what the sports nutrition category was doing. Our trailblazing line of plant-based sports nutrition supplements solves this dilemma, finally giving athletes and consumers effective plant-based sports nutrition products to maximize peak performance.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p><b><u>About PlantFuel Life Inc.<br/></u></b>PlantFuel Life Inc is a scientifically focused plant-based wellness company managed by a group of successful entrepreneurs who have extensive experience in the areas of consumer-packaged goods, manufacturing, logistics, and distribution.
