Julia will be succeeded by James Hatchley, who is currently the 3i Group Strategy Director. James will join the Group Board and the Executive Committee effective May 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">Julia joined 3i Group as Deputy Finance Director in 2006 and was made Group Finance Director and a member of the Executive Committee in 2008. She became a member of the Investment Committee in 2012.</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">James Hatchley joined 3i in 2017 as the Group's Strategy Director and has been a member of the Investment Committee since 2019. Prior to joining 3i, James was Chief Operating Officer of KKR in Europe and, before that, Co-CEO of Avoca Capital. Earlier in his career, James was a corporate finance professional for 20 years, principally with Greenhill &amp; Co. and Schroders, and is a Chartered Accountant.</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">David Hutchison, Chairman of 3i Group, said:</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\"I would like to thank Julia on behalf of the Board for her outstanding contribution over many years to the Company and the Board. We are delighted that we have a deep pool of talent within the Company and that James will succeed Julia as Group Finance Director. We very much look forward to his contribution to the Board over the coming years.\"</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">Simon Borrows, CEO of 3i Group, said: \u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\"Julia joined 3i in 2006 when 3i was a very different Company. She has helped to steer 3i through both the great financial crisis of 2007-9 and the Covid pandemic. Her part in the transformation of the Group since I was appointed as CEO in 2012 has been significant. She will remain with us until the next AGM which will allow for a smooth handover of responsibilities. Julia has been an outstanding Finance Director and colleague and her experience, judgement and common sense will be missed by us all when she does leave. After a thorough consideration of internal and external candidates, I am pleased that James has agreed to succeed Julia. He has already added significant value to the Group in his current Strategy role, in his contribution to the Investment Committee and to specific assets within the Group portfolio including Action and Scandlines. He will bring considerable internal and external experience to his new role.\"</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"cp\">-Ends-</p>\n<p class=\"cp\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"ck\">For further information, contact:</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"ck\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"cr\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"cg\" style=\"width:312\">\n<p class=\"cs\"><span class=\"ci\">Kathryn van der Kroft<br/>\nCommunications Director</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"ci\">\u00a0</span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"cf\" style=\"width:312\">\n<p class=\"ct\"><span class=\"ci\">020 7975 3021</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"ce\" style=\"width:312\">\n<p class=\"cu\"><span class=\"ck\">Silvia Santoro<br/>\nGroup Investor Relations Director</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"ci\">\u00a0</span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"cd\" style=\"width:312\">\n<p class=\"ct\"><span class=\"ck\">020 7975 3258</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table></div>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"ck\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"cu\"><span class=\"ck\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"cv\"><span class=\"ck\">Notes to Editors</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"cw\">About 3i Group</p>\n<p class=\"a\">3i is a leading international investment manager focused on mid-market Private Equity and Infrastructure.
