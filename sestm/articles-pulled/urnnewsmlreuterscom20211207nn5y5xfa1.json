Vayyar Care detects falls in all lighting conditions, including pitch darkness, and even dense steam, making it ideal for use in bathrooms where 80% of falls happen[1] and where customers may not want to have cameras. </p>\n<p>After a fall, standard buttons and cords are often out of reach and even wearables cannot guarantee round-the-clock protection: a third of seniors forget to put on their devices, while a fifth refuse to use them[2], fearing loss of independence.</p>\n<p>In fact, over 90% of seniors now prefer to continue to live independently rather than move into an assisted living community[3]. </p>\n<p>\"We designed Alexa Together to help aging customers feel more comfortable and confident living independently,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Nicolas Maynard</span>, Senior Manager, Amazon Alexa. \"Alexa Together offers even more value for aging customers when they can connect a device like Vayyar Care. We're excited to team up with Vayyar Imaging to help give our customers added peace of mind. </p>\n<p>When the Vayyar Care device detects a fall, it will send a signal to Alexa to ask if the customer wants to call the Alexa Together Urgent Response emergency helpline. Alexa will also send a notification to the aging loved one's caregiver. </p>\n<p>\"With today's seniors more empowered and engaged than ever, there's a clear need for smart technologies that enable them to maintain their lifestyles, providing the protection they demand and the peace-of-mind their families expect,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Raviv Melamed</span>, Vayyar Co-founder and CEO. \"That's exactly where Vayyar Care comes in, and I'm delighted that we're able to play a pivotal role in Amazon's new Alexa Together service.\" </p>\n<p>Vayyar Care builds on the global success of the company's B2B platform, which provides real-time fall detection and supports advanced activity analytics for senior living communities in the U.S., EU, <span class=\"xn-location\">China</span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Australia</span>, and beyond. </p>\n<p>The multifunctional sensing technology relies on low-power radio frequency waves, providing a safe, robust, and reliable solution for elderly people who want 24/7 protection without compromising their privacy or independence. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VAYYAR-Care-Touchless-Compatible-Detection/dp/B09JXV82Z6/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=vayyar+care&amp;qid=1637767926&amp;sr=8-2\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Vayyar Care is available now from amazon.com</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vayyar.com/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://vayyar.com/</a></p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/blog/aging-in-the-right-place-follow-these-easy-steps-to-make-your-bathroom-safer.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Aging in the Right Place: Follow These Easy Steps to Make Your Bathroom Safer</a><br/>[2] <a href=\"https://livius.com.au/news/pilot-study-3-of-3\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Pilot Study on Older Australians - Quality of Life (Part 3 of 3)</a><br/>[3] <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/10/2226492/0/en/NEARLY-90-OF-AMERICANS-AGE-50-AND-OLDER-WANT-TO-AGE-IN-PLACE.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Nearly 90% Of Americans Aged 50 and Older Want to \"Age in Place\"</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p><div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder2\">\n                <p>\n                        <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1703595/Vayyar.html\">\n                    <div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img alt=\"Vayyar to provide fall detection powered by touchless technology compatible with new Amazon Alexa Together service\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1703595/Vayyar.jpg\" title=\"Vayyar to provide fall detection powered by touchless technology compatible with new Amazon Alexa Together service\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9tbWEucHJuZXdzd2lyZS5jb20vbWVkaWEvMTcwMzU5NS9WYXl5YXIuanBn&amp;key=1edff1ac2d3c1713b3f2f1632e325c7cc27ba6fff76ce2c064e5b25ce7bff4686cb7d517f4acba6e80b2387d3552439cce55adcc89b6ee886a6f3def0ce4d0d5\"/></div></div>\n                        </a>\n                </p>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"PURL\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img alt=\"Cision\" src=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LN98122&amp;sd=2021-12-07\" title=\"Cision\" style=\"max-height:12px\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9jMjEyLm5ldC9jL2ltZy9mYXZpY29uLnBuZz9zbj1MTjk4MTIyJnNkPTIwMjEtMTItMDc=&amp;key=ba2aac2f8459da694d056577c8223eefa1dea93d76b71c0dcced8a72689f1f3639da89b99a393a3800b856ebb1cd39c1cfee7d4857f3635ec38de5ebb504cd57\"/></div></div> View original content to download multimedia:<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vayyar-to-provide-fall-detection-powered-by-touchless-technology-compatible-with-new-amazon-alexa-together-service-301439082.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vayyar-to-provide-fall-detection-powered-by-touchless-technology-compatible-with-new-amazon-alexa-together-service-301439082.html</a><p></p>\n<p>SOURCE  Vayyar</p>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 PR Newswire Association,LLC.
