In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended the clearance for the 2019 deal, holding that Amazon failed to notify it about certain details of its acquisition as required under law. CCI also imposed a penalty of Rs.202 crore on Amazon, which has now challenged the decision before NCLAT. On Wednesday, the apex court noted that the proceedings before NCLAT require to be decided first before other ancillary issues can be taken up by either the Supreme Court or the Delhi high court.
