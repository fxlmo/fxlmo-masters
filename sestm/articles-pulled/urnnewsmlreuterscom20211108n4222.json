Subsequently, a Delhi court also declined to give Future any immediate relief under Indian law to put the panel's decision on hold.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>The U.S. company has repeatedly argued that Future Retail must not proceed with the Reliance deal in light of the arbitration panel's decisions.</p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi<br/>Editing by David Goodman)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:aditya.kalra@tr.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">aditya.kalra@tr.com</a> ; +91-11-49548021; Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakalra\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://twitter.com/adityakalra</a>; ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
