GCX provides high-bandwidth connectivity to a range of blue-chip customers including hyperscalers, telecommunications operators, new media providers and enterprises. Its 66,000km of cables span 46 countries from North America to Asia, with a strong position on the Europe-Asia and Intra-Asia routes.\u00a0</p>\n              <p>\"This is a big acquisition for 3i Infrastructure, which utilises the \u00a3253m cash balance reported at half year and dips into the \u00a3400m RCF,\" analysts at RBC said. \"Connectivity is an area that 3i Infrastructure has spoken about in detail in the past, given the previous acquisition of Tampnet, and GCX appears to be on a strong growth trajectory, aligned with current portfolio assets ... the asset is highly cash-generative at present and the pricing point was attractive such that the asset generates an attractive return for 3i Infrastructure without having to rely on growth.\"</p>\n              <p>(Reporting by Rod Morrison)</p>\n              <p>((rod.morrison@refintiv.com; +44 204 503 3058))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
