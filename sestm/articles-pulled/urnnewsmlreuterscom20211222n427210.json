The case will likely be heard on Thursday. </p><p>The filing is the latest twist in the long-running dispute between Amazon and Future. Though India's antitrust body <a href=\"https://reut.rs/3GIXGX0\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">suspended</a> their 2019 deal last week, saying Amazon had suppressed information when seeking approvals for it, the ED's probe is independent of that.</p><p>The dispute centres around three commercial agreements signed between Future and Amazon entities, which a Singapore arbitration panel - also hearing the dispute - has said must be read together when reviewing the transaction.</p><p>Future contends conflating the commercial agreements would effectively mean the deal violated Indian law.</p><p>Amazon's court filing contained a notice from the ED dated Feb. 19 which sought details of its investment in Future, including copies of agreements, bank account details and other related internal communication.</p><p>It also showed the ED is conducting a far wider probe, and had sought details of big vendors on Amazon's e-commerce website in India, including sales numbers for those that account for more than 5% of total sales on Amazon.in.</p><p>The notice came after a February <a href=\"http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Reuters investigation which found</a> Amazon helped a small number of sellers prosper on its Indian platform, giving them discounted fees and using them to bypass foreign investment laws.</p><p>Amazon said at the time it was confident it complied with regulations and that it \"does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace.\"</p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi<br/>Editing by Mark Potter)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:aditya.kalra@tr.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">aditya.kalra@tr.com</a> ; +91-11-49548021; Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakalra\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://twitter.com/adityakalra</a>; ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
