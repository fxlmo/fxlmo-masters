They quoted a letter written by Amazon India legal head to Amazon CEO, mentioning a 25 per cent premium over regulatory price of FRL was being paid on account of the strategic rights and call options.</p><p>Originally, Amazon was to invest directly in FRL through the Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) route, but due to restrictions in Indian foreign investment laws the company decided to use a \"twin-entity investment\" structure.</p><p>That is, Amazon was to invest in FCPL and FCPL would acquire a 9.82 per cent of FRL, the letter added.</p><p>The letter, a copy of which was sent to BSE and Sebi, also alleged that Amazon gave different and contradictory reasons to courts and CCI for the investments. fe</p><p>Copyright 2021 IE Online Media Services Pvt.
