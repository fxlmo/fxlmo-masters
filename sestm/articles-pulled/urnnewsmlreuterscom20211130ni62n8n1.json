Often organizations have ended up with an \"accidental multi-cloud\" made up of\u00a0disparate tools and solutions to address different functions and applications. Unfortunately, moving to the cloud quickly has left many dealing with increased operational and deployment complexities, loss of visibility, and increased security risks, particularly in light of skills and resource gaps. When it comes to security, many have found that the biggest threat to their cloud deployments is not the threats themselves, but misconfiguration.\u00a0Fortinet Introduces New Cloud Services in AWS MarketplaceAmongst our customers, there is unanimous agreement that the future of cloud will remain fluid, and organizations need adaptable cloud solutions to provide them with flexibility to incrementally build toward their cloud of tomorrow.
