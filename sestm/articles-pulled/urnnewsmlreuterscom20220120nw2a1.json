Data destruction and hardware hacking pose a tremendous threat to individuals and organizations alike, and <span>The Insecurity of Everything</span> focuses on the common areas that data impacts in our modern day-to-day lives.\n</p><p>\n\u201cWe\u2019re humbled to learn this week that our book has been such as success,\u201d said John Shegerian, ERI\u2019s Chairman/CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly gratifying because we did not set for our book to be a money-maker, but a helpful and educational guide and reference for businesses and individuals. In an age of rapid technology turnover, mounting e-waste and the increasing presence of the internet of things, people, organizations and even government agencies are more vulnerable to hardware hacking than ever before \u2013 and our book is designed to equip readers so that they can protect themselves from breaches, hacks and cybercrime in general.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cIn our book,\u201d continued Shegerian, \u201cwe examine these issues in depth, and explore how they impact every person and organization around the globe today. We also share in detail the right ways to dispose of electronics to be both environmentally friendly and also sensitive to the prevention hardware data breaches. We\u2019re very proud of this book and excited that its critical information has been embraced by such a large audience.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<span><a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eridirect.com%2F&amp;esheet=52566217&amp;newsitemid=20220120005836&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ERI&amp;index=4&amp;md5=cb2d77edfac4cf6bd81f7de4f7dd0f60\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">ERI</a> is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.
