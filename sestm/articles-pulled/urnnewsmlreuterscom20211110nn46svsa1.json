Mr. Greenfeld says: \"An increasing number of American consumers are craving traditional sweet treats without all the junk, like artificial flavors, corn syrup, and sugar, driving a number of emerging brands to reinvent classic items, such as KitKat and Peanut Butter Cups, with a health and wellness twist. Dream Pops is thrilled to be part of this movement to help everyday shoppers eat better without sacrificing on taste.\" </p>\n<p>The category expansion comes on the heels of Dream Pops' recent successful <span class=\"xn-money\">$6 Million</span> fundraise contributed by\u00a0a list of notable institutional investors, CPG entrepreneurs, celebrities, and athletes. They include Melitas Ventures; <span class=\"xn-person\">Dan Levitan</span>, Co-Founding Partner of Maveron; <span class=\"xn-person\">Will Roush</span>; <span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Chetrit</span> from Chetrit Ventures; <span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Rubin</span>, the CEO of Fanatics; </p>\n<p>NFL quarterback, <span class=\"xn-person\">Cam Newton</span>; <span class=\"xn-person\">Steven Izen</span>, Founder and CEO of Lokai; <span class=\"xn-person\">Mike Fata</span>, Founder of Manitoba Harvest; <span class=\"xn-person\">Jake Kassan</span>, Founder of MVMT; <span class=\"xn-person\">Scott Belsky</span>, Co-Founder of Behance; <span class=\"xn-person\">Mark Birnbaum</span>, Co-Founder of Catch Hospitality Group; e-commerce entrepreneur, <span class=\"xn-person\">Eric Emanuel</span>; <span class=\"xn-person\">Mike Heller</span> &amp; <span class=\"xn-person\">Dave Spencer</span>, Co-Founders of Talent Resources; AE Ventures; and actor <span class=\"xn-person\">Diego Boneta</span>. </p>\n<p>Mr. Greenfeld says: \"In this round, we were eager to bring together a multi-faceted group of investors, entrepreneurs and institutions that believes in funding a challenger brand that can offer the same indulgent products as confectionery heavyweights, but with 100% plant-based and better-for-you ingredients. </p>\n<p>The <span class=\"xn-money\">$210.3 Billion</span> global confectionery market is expanding rapidly, and is expected to reach <span class=\"xn-money\">$270.5 Billion</span> in sales by </p>\n<p>2027, registering a CAGR of 3.6% during the forecast period, according to Allied Market Research. Mr. Greenfeld believes Dream Pops will be uniquely positioned to compete in this fast-growing sector, even as the sugar reduction trend marches on.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>He says: \"We are targeting American cult classic treats and re-imagining them with clean and better-for-you, plant-based ingredients. We are also using this capital to double down on our manufacturing, launch new frozen and nonfrozen innovations, scale DTC, and build our team.\" </p>\n<p>Dream Pops will also reach broader health-conscious audiences as it plans to add more than 1,000 retail stores in Q1 2021, and has received Whole Foods Market Global authorization, which will make Dream Pops Bites available across the world in September. </p>\n<p>\"Our 100% plant-based and better-for-you treats are here to stay, and we can't wait for consumers globally to discover our brand and add them to their daily dessert routine,\" Mr. Greenfeld says. </p>\n<p>For more information on our brand, please see our newsletter Ice Cream Sundays (which publishes every Sunday) and shares advice, tips and resources for building a successful CPG brand in 2021.
