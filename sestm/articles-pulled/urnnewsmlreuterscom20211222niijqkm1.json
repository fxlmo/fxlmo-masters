Amazon intends to occupy the new space in three phases, commencing first-quarter 2024.Moreover, Cousins Properties signed two leases for an aggregate of 95,000 square feet at its 100 Mill office development in Downtown Tempe, AZ. With this, the development, which is slated for delivery in the first half of 2022, is 80% preleased. This project is being developed by a joint venture in which Cousins Properties has a 90% ownership stake, while Hines owns the remaining 10% interest.A 63,000-square-foot expansion lease has been signed by Amazon for 100 Mill, leading its total square footage at the property to 158,000 square feet. The move comes as part of Amazon's growth plans for its Phoenix Tech Hub. In the first half of 2022, Amazon plans to occupy the initial 95,000 square feet and in the second half of 2022, it plans to occupy 63,000 square feet of expansion space. The other one at 100 Mill is a new 32,000-square-foot lease signed by a growing technology firm based in San Francisco \u2014 LiveRamp \u2014 for its new hub, thereby marking its foray into the Phoenix market.Demand for office space is strong both at Domain in Austin, TX and at 100 Mill in Tempe, AZ. With the latest development, Cousins Properties' 2.5-million-square-foot Domain portfolio is 99.7% leased. Also, with the availability of talent pool and easy accessibility, an increasing number of technology companies from the West Coast are choosing Phoenix as a market for expansion. Amid these, the leasing pipeline for residual space at 100 Mill remains strong.Cousins Properties has an unmatched portfolio of class A office assets concentrated in the high-growth Sun Belt markets. This region is experiencing a population influx. Hence, amid favorable migration trends and a pro-business environment, corporate relocations and expansions in the Sun Belt markets have been prominent, thereby driving demand for office space.Assets in these markets are also anticipated to command higher rents compared with the broader market. Hence, CUZ's leading trophy portfolio of class A and highly amenitized office realties across the Sun Belt region is positioned to benefit from the emerging trend.However, the office real estate market has been significantly affected by the pandemic, and the flexible working environment and its recovery is likely to be prolonged.
