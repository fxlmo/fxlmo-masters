It is uniquely placed to offer cutting-edge solutions for power operators to deliver safe, resilient, sustainable, and efficient services while minimizing risk and lowering total cost of operations.</p>\n<p>Today, the key players in the power and utilities sector are striving to balance the fuel mix through big data analytics, accelerating the adoption of natural gas and renewables; optimizing plant operations by using analytics to reduce cost and emissions while maximizing economic output; and developing new ways to interact with customers. The speed and scale of the digital transformation is impacting multiple industries. The digital agenda is being driven by a combination of technologies from cloud, analytics, mobile, machine learning to IoT. Together, these technologies are putting data and intelligence at the center of new business models. Industries, companies and business leaders are grappling with a world that is more volatile and more complex, yet demands greater agility, more speed, and more digital competence.</p>\n<p>Although power companies are making progress on digital transformation and many have adopted technologies that would be considered disruptive such as AI, analytics, and machine learning - many are still weighing up and exploring the opportunities. AVEVA\u2019s comprehensive industrial solutions portfolio ranges from the Digital Twin, Asset Strategy and Asset Performance Management to Connected Worker and Mobile Operator Rounds all designed to enhance digital acceleration and the utilization of cloud technologies across the power sector.</p>\n<p><strong>AVEVA\u2019s Proven Power Sector Track Record</strong></p>\n<p>AVEVA has a track record of co-innovation with major power and utilities customers globally who rely on AVEVA solutions to increase efficiency and safety of workers, improve plant reliability, reduce risks, augment productivity and advance overall business performance with transformative digital and cloud solutions.</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Leading global producer and distributer of electricity and gas ENEL recently deployed AI-infused AVEVA Predictive Analytics to drive its autonomous plant vision.

It requires investing in infrastructure and new technologies; changing mindsets, public policies, and business models; investing in people through education and on-the-job skills upgrading and developing open standards and ensuring interoperability. It also will require the highest degree of cyber security against potential data privacy and system security risks.</p>\n<p>The current challenging macro-economic environment means that it is even more vital for power companies to equip themselves with technologies that will modernize legacy systems and processes to propel them into the digital future.
