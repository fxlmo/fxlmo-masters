Sadly stigma, particularly around mental health, means some employees still believe they could face repercussions if they reveal they are struggling, which should never be the case in any workplace.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><strong>Action employers can take</strong></p>\n<p>The survey data shows there are a number of steps employers can take to remove this stigma and encourage employees to seek the help they need:</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li><strong><span>Encourage leaders to be more empathetic and enhance the communication on health and well-being</span></strong> \u2014 35% of UAE respondents said they would be more likely to access health and well-being support if leadership communicated more about available resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li><strong><span>Build a culture and work environment where employees feel safe to openly discuss the physical, mental and emotional issues they are facing</span></strong> \u2014 33% of UAE employees said that knowing there is clear policy on mental health that ensures they will not be penalized for accessing support and 38% said that knowing their peers are also accessing the same resources would be two key criteria that will encourage them to use more employer provided health and well-being resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li><strong><span>Offer regular trainings and webinars</span></strong> specifically around practical tips for managing well-being and how to spot and support employees and colleagues who might be struggling with mental health.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>\u201cThe lessons and research over the past 18 months have made it clear that a more compassionate and open workplace culture is the first step in fostering better employee health. A culture where we encourage employees to talk about important issues, thereby easing the pressure to exude an aura of resilience \u2014 never ill, always ready for more work, available 24/7. In a competitive world, nobody wants to be thought of as the weak link. But normalizing discussions around issues such as health, and particularly mental wellness, could become one of the most important requirements of a sound talent strategy and company culture in the post-COVID economy,\u201d</span> concluded Healy.</p>\n<p>-Ends-</p>\n<p><strong>About Aetna International</strong></p>\n<p><span>Aetna International is committed to helping create a stronger, healthier global community by delivering comprehensive health care benefits and population health solutions worldwide.
