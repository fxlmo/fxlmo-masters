The company uses AWS\ncapabilities in high performance computing, analytics, machine learning,\ndatabase, storage, and security to accelerate drug discovery and\ndevelopment, and process health data at scale to deliver high-quality,\nindividually tailored care. Roche also works with AWS Professional Services\nto integrate its information technology (IT) systems so that it can\nsecurely share data as needed both within the company and with key external\nstakeholders such as academic institutions, regulatory agencies, and\nhealthcare providers, while Roche complies with laws and guidelines to\nprotect patient privacy.\n  AWS's secure infrastructure and portfolio of services power Roche's\npersonalized healthcare program. While biopharmaceutical companies have\nbeen pursuing personalized medicine for over two decades, only recently\nhave advances in data, analytics, and digital technology positioned the\nhealthcare industry for transformational change. Roche uses AWS analytics\nand database services like Amazon OpenSearch Service (AWS's service for\nsearching, visualizing, and analyzing up to petabytes of text and\nunstructured data) and Amazon Aurora (AWS's MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible\nrelational database built for the cloud) to help it gain actionable\ninsights from its enterprise, research, clinical, digital health, and\nreal-world patient data. With AWS, Roche can examine health data at scale\nrelated to patients' genetic makeup, overall health, and drug efficacy and\ninteractions, analyzing structured datasets of de-identified patient data\nthat Roche anonymizes and aggregates to protect patient privacy. This\ncapability gives Roche researchers a more detailed understanding of patient\nbiology across larger patient populations, and can help them identify\npatterns and outliers that inform development of diagnostics and\ntreatments.\n\n  \"With profound advances in data, analytics, and digital technology, we\nare transforming the way medicines are discovered and developed, and how\ncare is delivered to patients. AWS provides us with high-performance and\nsecure cloud solutions that help to harness the power of data to improve\npatients' lives,\" said Dr. Alan Hippe, CFO and CIO of Roche Group. \"With\nAWS, we are bringing together health data in new ways to better detect,\ndiagnose, treat, monitor, and manage diseases more effectively and\nefficiently for the benefit of patients. Roche complies with all applicable\ndata privacy laws--including but not limited to the Swiss Data Protection\nAct, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the US\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and China's\nCybersecurity Law and associated data privacy standard.\"\n\n  AWS powers Roche's use of digital technologies like smartphone apps that\ncan support healthcare professionals in providing individually tailored\ncare and allow patients to play a role in managing their own health. AWS\nservices such as AWS Lambda (a serverless, event-driven compute service),\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Amazon SageMaker (AWS's\nservice that helps developers and data scientists build, train, and deploy\nmachine learning models quickly) allow Roche to ingest, store, process, and\nrapidly analyze health data collected by smart devices. For instance, Roche\nbuilt and runs its mySugr app on AWS to securely aggregate and analyze data\nsuch as blood glucose measurements for patients with diabetes. Roche uses\nthe app to automatically pull and analyze data from smart meters to better\ninform a patient's schedule and dosing for medication. Across its range of\ndigital healthcare applications, Roche continuously and securely collects\nand analyzes patient health data in the cloud, giving the patient and their\nhealthcare providers a more timely, precise understanding of how diseases\nprogress and respond to treatment.\n\n  Roche also uses AWS's scalable high performance computing capabilities,\nalong with AWS container and analytics services like Amazon Redshift (AWS's\ncloud data warehousing service), to securely process and extract insights\nfrom dozens of petabytes of genomic data from more than 300,000 consenting\ncancer patients globally while maintaining patient privacy. Roche uses\nAmazon FSx for Lustre (AWS's service that provides cost-effective,\nhigh-performance, scalable storage for compute workloads) to store that\ngenomic data and make it quickly available for analysis. With the support\nof AWS, Roche continues to expand its knowledge base of cancers to identify\nfuture cases more rapidly.\n\n  Roche enhances the value of its tumor-profiling work with patient health\ninsights derived from aggregated electronic health records it processes on\nAWS. Roche runs its analytics, machine learning, storage, and managed\ndatabase applications on AWS, helping it extract and standardize\nhigh-quality data from more than 3 million electronic health records to\nproduce de-identified, real-world patient datasets. These include petabytes\nof oncology data and other protected health information that Roche\nresearchers use to guide their work and inform the design of clinical\ntrials.\n\n  \"With AWS powering its research, development, and healthcare operations,\nRoche can deliver timely, relevant data that helps scientists collaborate\nmore securely and effectively, researchers design more efficient clinical\ntrials, caregivers make decisions with more accuracy, and patients take\ngreater control over their health,\" said Kathrin Renz, Vice President of\nBusiness Development and Industries at Amazon Web Services. \"AWS is helping\nthe healthcare and life sciences industry cross the threshold of\npersonalized medicine, reduce the time and cost for clinical trials, and\nimprove patients' health outcomes through digital healthcare. With AWS,\nRoche is turning complex health data into a resource rather than an\nobstacle and reducing the time it takes to get new medicines into the hands\nof patients.\"\n\n  About Amazon Web Services\n\n  For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world's most\ncomprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.
