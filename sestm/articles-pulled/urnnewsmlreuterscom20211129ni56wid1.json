The collaboration with Amazon Pay and AWS marks another milestone for YES BANK, among the market leaders in UPI payments. In FY 2020-21, YES BANK recorded a market share of around 40% by volume in the UPI ecosystem and around 30% by volume in the UPI merchant acquiring business.Based on a multi-bank model, this collaboration allows YES BANK to acquire merchants through the Amazon Pay platform, further extending the Bank's presence in the UPI merchant business segment.YES BANK has developed a cloud-native UPI processing platform to optimally handle the high traffic of transactions observed during surge periods like festivals or annual sales. The Bank is hosting its UPI processing platform on AWS. With AWS, the Bank will have more flexibility to scale with the exponential growth in UPI volumes driven by high customer demand.Welcoming the development,\u00a0Prashant Kumar, MD &amp; CEO,\u00a0YES BANK, said, \"In our efforts to provide greater ease and convenience to our customers by continually simplifying payment journeys for them, YES BANK is pleased to announce its partnership with Amazon Pay and AWS.

As our country embraces the change in the transaction environment from cash to digital, this timely integration will allow the Bank to better serve the evolving payment preferences of our customers, driving satisfaction levels and a superior and seamless payment experience.\"Mahendra Nerurkar, CEO and Vice President, Amazon Pay, added, \"It is our endeavor to make digital payments trusted, convenient, and rewarding for customers across India.
