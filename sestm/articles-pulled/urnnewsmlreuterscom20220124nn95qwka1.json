The winners reflect the highest overall numerical scores based on an analysis of questionnaires submitted by employers and survey responses from their employees.</p>\n<p>\"Ad Age's Best Places to Work is a highly-coveted award that reaffirms Tinuiti as a best in business and culture place to be and that's why we continue to attract, retain, and cultivate the very best talent in the industry.

Tinuiti welcomed nearly 700 new employees in the last 12 months, nearing 1,100 in headcount, a 59% year-over-year increase. The firm has consistently been on the forefront of emerging spaces years ahead of the competition\u2014from the Amazon and Retail Media space, a respected industry thought leader on data privacy, to breaking out ahead on streaming advertising. The company is <u><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3421786-1&amp;h=3470265454&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinuiti.com%2Fcareers%2Fjob-openings%2F&amp;a=currently+hiring\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">currently hiring</a></u> for multiple roles across divisions to keep pace with growth.</p>\n<p><b>Talent Over Geography<br/></b>Unlike most other marketing agencies and tech companies, Tinuiti has been a \"talent over geography\" company since the beginning, allowing the top minds in the industry to work from wherever they'd like. Tinuiti made its first remote hire back in 2008 and a decade later, the majority of its employees work remotely. Tinuiti's core values and company culture allow the firm to continuously attract and retain the top minds in digital marketing wherever they live, embracing the agency's 'talent over geography' philosophy to build the best team of thought leaders in the industry.</p>\n<p><b>Growing Happiness is Fundamental<br/></b>Tinuiti\u00a0has used its status as an independent agency to create a thriving work culture where people want to give their best every day and have fun while they're at it\u2014while also being recognized for the work they do, receiving generous benefits and being seen and heard at their jobs. This culture of ownership fuels the company flywheel, which is aided by reinvesting into the business through technology, innovation and people.</p>\n<p>In 2021, Tinuiti debuted three innovative employee activations designed to grow employee happiness, unite Tinuitians in person for the first time, prioritize mental health over profits, and give back to local communities (a program that recently took home a Web Excellence Award for Corporate Communications). The activations\u2014called Second Impressions, Recharge, and Thankful Giving\u2014will continue to evolve in 2022 as Tinuiti cements its place as the industry leader in innovation when it comes to agency culture.</p>\n<p><b>A Proven Home For Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion <br/></b>Tinuiti\u00a0is growing fast but has never been more devoted to building an inclusive workforce. The firm remains committed to improving diversity, equity and inclusion at the company and in the digital marketing industry at large through informative webinars, philanthropic initiatives and leading by example with new hires. Overall, of Tinuiti's\u00a0entire employee base of 1000+ people, 68 percent identify as women and is proud of its 57% percent female representation in leadership. Tinuiti\u00a0also strives for racial equality in the workplace with a public pledge to have over 35% of our employees from underrepresented minority groups (Black, Indigenous, People of Color)\u00a0by 2023. The firm is strongly positioned to exceed that goal ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p><b>Winning Major Industry Culture Awards<br/></b>Tinuiti\u00a0has received numerous awards for its culture including ranking #1 in <u style=\"font-size:10pt\"><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3421786-1&amp;h=2985192288&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinuiti.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Ftinuiti-ranked-number-1-best-place-to-work-by-ad-age-for-the-second-consecutive-year%2F&amp;a=Ad+Age%27s+2019+%26+2020+Best+Workplaces\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Ad Age's 2019 &amp; 2020 Best Workplaces</a></u>, receiving an <u style=\"font-size:10pt\"><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3421786-1&amp;h=3465720501&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdigiday.com%2Fawards%2Fbloomberg-media-group-and-new-york-media-take-top-honors-in-the-digiday-worklife-awards%2F&amp;a=Employer+of+the+Year+and+Top+Boss+awards+from+Digiday\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Employer of the Year and Top Boss awards from Digiday</a></u>, and being named to <u style=\"font-size:10pt\"><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3421786-1&amp;h=223523440&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinuiti.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fincbestplaces2021%2F&amp;a=Inc.%27s+Best+Places+to+Work\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Inc.'s Best Places to Work</a></u>\u00a0list in 2020 and 2021.
