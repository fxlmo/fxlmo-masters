The Company owns and operates its own channels, and the communities attached to them, as well as offering customers a suite of advertising services to help reach digital audiences.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Brave Bison has two core lines of business. Firstly, the publishing of content on social media channels to generate advertising revenue. Brave Bison operates over 650 channels including PGA Tour and US Open on YouTube, Cooking Wild and DIY &amp; Crafts on Facebook and Slick and VSatisfying on Snap Discover. The amount of revenue generated from a channel depends on how many people watch the content, who these people are and where they are based.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The second line of business involves the execution of social and digital advertising campaigns for global, blue-chip brands such as Panasonic, New Balance, Primark, Vodafone and Samsung. Key advertising channels include Paid Search (on advertising platforms such as Google and Amazon), Paid Social (on advertising platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok), Influencer Marketing and eCommerce Technology (on commerce platforms such as SAP, Salesforce, BigCommerce). These advertising services generate fee-based income, typically from customers retained for 12 months or more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This is an RNS Reach announcement and the information contained is not considered to be material or to have a significant impact on management's expectations of the Group's performance.
