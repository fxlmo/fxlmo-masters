This comes amid a clear strategy by AWS to grow its presence across the UK Government, with its revenue reaching a high of \u00a388m in fiscal year 2020-21. This includes doubling its revenue with HMRC in 2020-21 alone (\u00a351m) and record highs with the Department for Work and Pensions (\u00a314m) in 2020-21 and Home Office (\u00a325m) in 2019-20.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        \"While no official contract has been published yet, early reports suggest the new AWS deal is worth between \u00a3500m to \u00a31bn over the next ten years, significantly boosting UK Government revenue with the cloud provider. The deal was signalled last October when Strategic Command, the intelligence-focused branch within the Ministry of Defence (MoD), published a pre-tender looking for a supplier to deliver a SECRET (classification level) cloud capability. Codenamed the EMPORIUM Project, the supplier would be responsible for migrating MoD data to a new private cloud environment - something that would require the supplier to have access to MoD secure networks and data centres.\"\n      </p>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"public_attachments\">\n                <p>\n                  <strong>Attachments</strong>\n                </p>\n                <ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n                  <li>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.globaldata.com/amazons-deal-uk-spy-agencies-likely-push-revenue-uk-government-record-yearly-high-88m-says-globaldata/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Original document</a>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"public_disclaimer\">\n                <p>\n                  <strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <strong>GlobalData plc</strong> published this content on <strong>09 November 2021</strong> and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.
