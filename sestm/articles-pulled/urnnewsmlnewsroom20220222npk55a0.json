The Plants for Your Pits deodorants are a radical departure from traditional deodorants in the marketplace in that they combine botanical ingredients and essential oils to also help enhance the way we think and feel.\"</p>\n<p>Green Goo proudly donates <span>$.05</span> of every deodorant sold to <span>\n<a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3450237-1&amp;h=1179630386&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgreengoo.com%2Fpages%2Fphilanthropy&amp;a=Keep+A+Breast+Foundation\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Keep A Breast Foundation</a>\n</span> .
