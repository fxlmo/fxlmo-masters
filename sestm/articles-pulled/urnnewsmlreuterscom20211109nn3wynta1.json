We're excited to make migration a better experience for everyone.\"</p>\n<p>The CloudZero MAP Dashboard provides otherwise difficult-to-obtain details about MAP workloads \u2014 including a summary of credits, inventory of assets, and complete picture of total spend. Customers can easily understand how many creditable workloads they have tagged to date, to estimate the number of credits that they will receive. Organizations can also drill into any account or service to see the cost and discount associated with each individual workload. This visibility ensures customers never overlook a MAP eligible workload\u00a0and always have a continuous understanding of their spend and discounts.</p>\n<p>\"We were able to migrate faster and more confidently with MAP visibility from CloudZero,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Gary McKay</span>, director of agile service delivery at Somos. \"It saved us from missing tags and losing out on AWS credits and allowed me to keep our executive team informed on progress and expected savings. In summary, CloudZero has given us more insight and control over our AWS costs, allowing us to optimize better.\"</p>\n<p>Visit <u><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3352226-1&amp;h=1916232043&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudzero.com%2Fmap&amp;a=cloudzero.com%2Fmap\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">cloudzero.com/map</a></u> to purchase the CloudZero MAP dashboard today.</p>\n<p><b>About CloudZero<br/></b>CloudZero puts engineering in control of cloud cost, by connecting technical decisions with business results.
