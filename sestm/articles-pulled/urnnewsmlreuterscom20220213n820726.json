Part of that push, Apollo said, is to install solar energy systems on other large buildings at Amazon that are unable to support more commonly used solar panels.</p><p>Apollo's flexible solar energy films are made for surfaces such as on aircraft or cars and will also be tested in space, the company says.</p><p>The 50-square-metre sidewalk on the approach to the French warehouses will generate solar power while people walk and bike on it, Apollo said.</p><p>Apollo said in a regulatory filing it expects the project to be completed by the end of the year, though there was no guarantee it will succeed or that Apollo's system will be installed at other Amazon sites.</p><p>Apollo said it is already collaborating with Audi and Volkswagen for bringing solar technology to automobiles.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>($1 = 0.8811 euros)</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:ari.rabinovitch@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">ari.rabinovitch@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; +972-2-632-2202; Reuters Messaging: <a href=\"mailto:ari.rabinovitch@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">ari.rabinovitch@thomsonreuters.com</a> @reuters.net))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
