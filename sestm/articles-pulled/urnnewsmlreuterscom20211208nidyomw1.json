The Democratic-led House is unlikely to take it up, which means the mandate would stand, though courts have put it on hold for now. Still, the vote would give senators a chance to come out against a policy that they say has sparked fears back home from businesses and from unvaccinated constituents worried about losing their jobs should the rule go into effect.</p><p>MacKenzie Scott won't say how much she's giving 'this time'</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In a blog post titled \"No Dollar Signs This Time,\" billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott said she won't reveal how much she has given to charity since her last round of donations earlier this year, in an effort to reduce the attention she draws.

The medication known as Aduhelm would be protected from Medicare price negotiations for more than a decade under the Democratic drug pricing compromise before Congress. That's because the bill doesn't allow Medicare to negotiate over newly launched drugs. Seniors soon will be paying higher premiums so Medicare can set aside a contingency fund for Aduhelm. Medicare's Part B premium will jump by $21.60 a month next year, to $170.10.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 14.46 points, or 0.3%, to 4,701.21.
