It was billed as a way for sellers to avoid constantly monitoring and changing product prices. Instead, Amazon would optimize the price, guaranteeing sellers a minimum price. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon used the program to prevent third party sellers from undercutting Amazon's prices.</p><p>This hurt consumers, the lawsuit alleges, because it removed the possibility that a specific product would be discounted. It also hurt sellers, according to the complaint, because it led consumers to more often buy products directly from Amazon, since third party sellers did not offer a lower price.</p><p>As part of the legally binding resolution filed Wednesday, Amazon must check in with the Attorney General's office once a year for five years, certifying that it is in compliance with the agreement.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the settlement.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 The Washington Post</p></div>"}
