A very good morning, you're watching Proactive London. Michael Infante is joining us here today from One Media IP group because you haven't announced the appointment of Nick Stewart as Chief Executive Officer of your anti-piracy business TCAT. And this is happening from next Monday, he's got an impressive career which will take us through some of those details, but we're also going to learn as accompany what you've been up to over the last year or so as well because it's busy times, the Michael a Walmart comes to take us through where you're at and where you're going. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Good morning. We've appointed Nick, he takes over as CEO, now newly formed independent limited company, we're raising money directly into TCAT and TCAT will stand as a standalone business with OneMeter as a significant investor in it. One Media as you know is a content business, we raise money in the past to acquire content TCAT is very different is a software business. The technical copyright analysis tool, which is what TCAT stand though because we come into use, referred to in houses to catch a thief. Primarily, it's working for the moment on trial basis with a couple of major record companies and also companies, society should I say, connected with the music industry. We have to give TCAT all the tools it needs. So we're currently on a fundraise to give TCAT its full independence, One Media will remain a significant investor in TCAT in terms of shareholding, we have advanced HTML, VCT, EIS approval, so we're attracting institutions and that's progressing nicely. Nick's appointments is really important because TCAT has two avenues it will go down. One working with the major labels, also working with major artists. And Nick's roster of artists that he's worked for ranging from Elton John to Thin Lizzy, Michael Bolton, and a number of other artists, Rod Stewart, 30, 40 years in this industry makes him key as TCAT to contact artists to start talking to them about the very problem. I'll not go into huge detail about what TCAT does but there are issues arising and it's been documented by us and others about infiltration onto Amazon, onto Spotify, onto iTunes and a number of stores whereby metadata is being altered and changed, infringing content is being uploaded, not by the owners and our fingerprinted method of searching across these tools, finds them, reports it to the owners of that content and it's then for them to decide what action they want to take. So we've now announced an exciting board, it's now led by chairman Ed Vernon, Nick joins that board and ably assisted with, of course, the CTO who's driving the software, Gareth Waller. These guys are based in Belfast. We've taken advantage of setting up in Belfast because they're the resident there but equally, there are some incentives from the government to set up software businesses over there. And as we know, One Media is not an incubator for a software business, we are purely a content supplier. So looking here at the board, you can see the construction of the board and it's a very filled board in terms of experience, myself as Board Advisor, continuing Alice Dyson, our CEO is on the board representing One Media and then the rest of the team from Ed Vernon, Gareth Waller, Nick Stewart, and Robin Abeyesinhe, a very capable CFO that we've worked with over 18, 20 years now. Moving on, we also can then see a couple of testimonial videos here from existing users of TCAT that have been on trial basis with us and we have Barry Blue, the One Media did some business with last year when we acquired the heatwave music and the producer's royalty from there. And of course, Steve Levine who is the producer of Culture Club, the Karma Chameleon tracks that One Media required. Both these gentlemen have been using TCAT now since our deal with them, and it's been protecting the rights in the partnership that we've set up with how many IP with them. &gt;&gt; High, I'm Steve Levine. Britain Award winner and record producer of coach clubs worldwide, number one hit Karma Chameleon. TCAT software helps protect my music and is the future of anti-piracy. &gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Barry Blue. I'm an artist, a songwriter, and producer of a multi-million selling band heatwave, whose many hits including Boogie Nights and always and forever and now protected by One Media's fantastic technology TCAT. &gt;&gt; TCAT currently is a business-to-business model. We're working with some major record labels and we had this stage still can't mention the names of those labels due to NDAs, but there are only five major record labels and we're working with two of them and the world's largest music aggregator. The way we work with them is to check their ingestion status of their content on a weekly basis and they give us projects to work on across various stores to do investigations. Now this is a B2B operation and it works terribly well, but the way they're set up, our intention in the future, 23 is to create a mobile app to put TCAT into the hands of the mass populous and to then write the way down to a chapter or a woman in a local band can start looking at where their content is being used and how that content is being used territorially. The idea of this is that currently up until now, the only way an artist really understands where his product's being used is when he gets a royalty report from his record label. This starts to enable artists, it's not looking at where their content's being used and to start crosscheck checks and balances with regards to where their concert is. It won't give them numbers, it won't tell them how many streams they're doing, it does or will create a popularity index but what it doesn't do is create numbers that's something confidential between the store and of course the artists themselves. But it is a method of actually cross-checking where that content is being offered. &gt;&gt; Michael thank you very much indeed for that presentation here on proactive London this morning from One Media IP group, that's Michael Infante.<br/></span></div></div></div></div>"}
