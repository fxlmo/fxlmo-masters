The apex court was listening to a plea in which Future Retail dragged its own lenders to the court to prevent them from declaring the company as a defaulter. <br/><br/>\u201cAmazon and Reliance, who are cash rich, can bid for Future Retail anything above 170 billion rupees ($2.27 billion) and let them take (over the assets),\u201d Rakesh Dwivedi, the counsel representing the lenders, told the Supreme Court bench presided by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana. \u201cThis is sure shot (method by which) we get our money, and who wins (will) get Future Retail. This is the one and only solution.\u201d<br/><br/>The counsel for Future Group, Harish Salve, sought two weeks\u2019 time to discuss the issue with the lenders and agreed to the proposal. Amazon\u2019s counsel Gopal Subramaniam also said the company had \u201cno problem to engage with banks\u201d and that it was \u201cprepared to discuss the matter with lenders.\u201d<br/><br/>The court directed all the respective parties to come to a solution and refused to pass an order on the plea. It adjourned the case, without giving a hearing date.<br/><br/>Some of Future Retail's lenders include State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank. The lenders\u2019 consortium had issued default notices to the company after it missed its repayment deadline and classified the account as non-performing assets.<br/><br/>Future alleged that the lenders issued default notices to the group \u201cerroneously,\u201d despite its intent to adhere to the timelines as stated in the framework agreement. The acts of the lenders are \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary and without any justification or reasoning,\u201d and severely hamper its right to carry on trade and business, it had said.<br/><br/>Future Group, which is on the brink of liquidation, has been locked in a long-drawn-out legal dispute with Amazon, which in 2019 picked up a 49% stake in Future Coupons, the group\u2019s gift voucher unit, and owned a 7.3% stake in Future Retail, effectively giving the U.S. e-commerce company a foothold in the retailer. <br/><br/>In 2020, much to the chagrin of Amazon, Future agreed to sell its entire retail, wholesale, warehousing, and logistics businesses to billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries in a $3.4 billion deal. The dispute started after Amazon sought to block the Reliance deal by getting a freeze order from a Singapore arbitration court, citing alleged violation of contractual agreements. The merged entity will pose formidable competition to the U.S. company\u2019s dominance in India. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court today reserved an earlier order from the National Company Law Tribunal on allowing Future Retail to proceed with the deal with Reliance.<br/>   - By Siddhi Nayak; siddhi.nayak@newsrise.org; 91-22-61353307<br/>- Edited by Sunil Nair<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
