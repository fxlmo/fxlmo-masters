Under the terms of the Transaction, the Group's subsidiary Airtel Tanzania plc will continue to develop, maintain and operate its equipment on the towers under a separate lease arrangement with the Purchaser.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"ai\">The Transaction is the latest strategic divestment of the Group's tower portfolio as it focusses on an asset-light business model and on its core subscriber-facing operations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"ai\">The consideration for the Transaction is approximately $175m of which approximately $157.5m is payable on the first closing date (which is expected to take place in the second half of the Group's current financial year) with the balance payable in instalments upon the completion of the transfer of any remaining towers to the Purchaser. </span><span class=\"al\">Around $60m from the proceeds will be used to invest in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania and for distribution to the Government of Tanzania, as per the settlement described in the Airtel Africa IPO Prospectus document published in June 2019. The balance of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt at Group level.</span></p>\n<p class=\"w\"><span class=\"al\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"an\"><span class=\"al\">-ENDS-</span></p>\n<p class=\"an\"><span class=\"al\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\">Enquiries</span></p>\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"as\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\">Airtel Africa - Investor Relations</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">Pier Falcione</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">Morten Singleton</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span><span class=\"al\"><a href=\"mailto:Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com</a></span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">+44 207 493 9315</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\"><br/></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\"><br/></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"ar\"><span class=\"al\">Hudson Sandler</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">Nick Lyon</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">Bertie Berger</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span><span class=\"al\"><a href=\"mailto:airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com</a></span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"af\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"al\">+44 207 796 4133</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table></div>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">About Airtel Africa</span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"ai\">Airtel Africa is a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, with a presence in 14 countries in Africa, primarily in East Africa and Central and West Africa.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"ai\">Airtel Africa offers an integrated suite of telecommunications solutions to its subscribers, including mobile voice and data services as well as mobile money services both nationally and internationally.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"ai\">The Group aims to continue providing a simple and intuitive customer experience through streamlined customer journeys. </span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"al\"><a href=\"http://www.airtel.africa\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.airtel.africa</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"au\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"ai\">About SBA Communications Corporation</span></p>\n<p class=\"av\"><span class=\"ai\">SBA Communications Corporation is a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including towers, buildings, rooftops, distributed antenna systems (DAS) and small cells.
