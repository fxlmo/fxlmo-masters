The new radio is one of the industry?s lightest dual-band radios supporting both Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) and Broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS) spectrums.</p><p>AWS and PCS are important mid-band spectrums, offering a good mixture of coverage and capacity. By combining them into a ?one box? solution, mobile operators gain a simplified approach to capacity extension.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>As the lightest and most compact AWS/PCS dual-band Massive MIMO radio available in the market, Samsung?s new radio stands out for its ability to deliver high output power (320W) in a small form factor. It is equipped with the company?s latest System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and built to improve network capacity and coverage, while decreasing its power consumption and radio size. This will enable operators to reduce their radio footprint, the weight placed on towers, and installation time, helping to drive faster rollouts and operational efficiency.</p><p>?We are excited to launch a new dual-band 16T16R Massive MIMO radio, adding to our 5G radio lineup to expand our extensive portfolio of cutting-edge network solutions,? said Dong Geun Lee, Vice President and Head of H/W RandD Group, Networks Business at Samsung Electronics. ?With Samsung?s high-performance dual-band Massive MIMO radio, which features one of the smallest footprints in the industry, operators will be able to easily boost network capacity and accelerate network rollouts.?</p><p>The AWS/PCS Dual-band Massive MIMO Radio is the company?s first 16T16R FDD dual-band Massive MIMO radio. It is now commercially available, along with Samsung?s AWS/PCS Dual-band 4T4R Radio. Samsung continues to offer a comprehensive lineup of radios covering low-band, mid-band and mmWave in North America.</p><p>Samsung Networks has pioneered the successful delivery of 5G end-to-end infrastructure solutions including chipsets, radios, and core. Through ongoing research and development, Samsung drives the industry to advance 5G networks with its market-leading product portfolio from fully virtualized RAN and Core to private network solutions and AI-powered automation tools. The company is currently providing network solutions to mobile operators that deliver connectivity to hundreds of millions of users around the world.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.</p></div>"}
