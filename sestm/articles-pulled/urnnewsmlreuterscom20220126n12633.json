But on Wednesday afternoon, the NLRB told the group that they had cleared the hurdle, Smalls said. </p><p>    Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the company was seeking more information about how the signatures were verified<span class=\"tr-strong\">.</span></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re skeptical that there are a sufficient number of legitimate signatures,\" Nantel said in a statement. \"Our employees have always had a choice of whether or not to join a union, and as we saw just a few months ago, the vast majority of our team in Staten Island did not support the ALU.\u201d</p><p>The NLRB will hold a hearing regarding the upcoming election on Feb. 16.</p><p>Amazon is facing a growing volley of campaigns to organize its vast workforce. Next month, workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama will vote again on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). Amazon handily defeated the union campaign last year, but the NLRB called for another vote after finding the company improperly interfered in the first contest.</p><p>    </p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Julia Love; additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Leslie Adler and Aurora Ellis)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:Julia.Love@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Julia.Love@thomsonreuters.com</a> , @byJuliaLove; 52 (55) 5282-7131; ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
