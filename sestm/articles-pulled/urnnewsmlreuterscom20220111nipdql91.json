Henderson also rejected Amazon's argument that it was making voting easier and was trying to encourage as high a turnout as possible.</p><p>\"Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU last year,\" said Amazon spokeswoman Barbara Agrait in an emailed statement Tuesday, adding that she looks forward to having its team in Bessemer '\"having their voices heard again.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the RWDSU took issue with NLRB's decision to hold an election by mail.</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election,\" said the union in a statement. It said it proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that it felt could have made the process fairer to workers, which have not been taken up thus far. The union did not specify its concerns or remedies.</p><p>RWDSU faces an uphill battle to unionize workers given such high quit rates, but Amazon did reach a settlement with the NLRB last month to allow its employees to freely organize \u2014 and without retaliation.</p><p>According to the settlement, the online behemoth said it would reach out to its warehouse workers \u2014 former and current \u2014 via email who were on the job anytime from March 22 of last year to notify them of their organizing rights.</p><p>The settlement outlined that Amazon workers, which number 750,000 in the U.S., have more room to organize within the buildings. For example, Amazon pledged it will not threaten workers with discipline or call the police when they are engaging in union activity in exterior non-work areas during non-work time.</p><p>Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio</a> </p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Associated Press.
