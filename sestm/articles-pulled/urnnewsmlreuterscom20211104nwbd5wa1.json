(CSC), the world\u2019s leading innovator in cyber threat intelligence and AI-driven web security, today announced a major release of WafCharm, the SaaS that automates and optimizes AWS WAF rule operations to help address web-related cyber attacks against business and critical government infrastructure increasing worldwide. WafCharm eliminates frequent mistakes and eases the burden of complex WAF rule creation and modification shouldered by developers. The release is an enterprise-grade, production-ready, affordable SaaS now supported by U.S.-based customer service representatives.\n</p><p>\n<b>Survey Reveals Cloud and Web Developers \u201cOverwhelmed\u201d by Key Cybersecurity Burden</b>\n</p><p>\nA well managed WAF, or web application firewall, prevents web-based attacks at the application layer and protects against exploits directed at application programming interface (API) vulnerabilities. Software developers and security engineers can tune WAF rules to block malicious traffic from entering a site and can prevent data from being extracted as a result of an intrusion that finds a way through.\n</p><p>\nA recent 2021 CSC <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wafcharm.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fwaf-in-the-cloud&amp;esheet=52521258&amp;newsitemid=20211104005290&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=survey&amp;index=1&amp;md5=81fd682de88a9e03a422121d3c076490\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">survey</a> of developers found that almost three-quarters, 72%, at all WAF skill levels said they are overwhelmed with WAF rules and conditions\u2014and a telling 71% of WAF experts said the same thing. A stunning 94% of developers are interested in automated managed rules for WAF operation, instead of managing the rules themselves.\n</p><p>\n\u201cEffective WAF operation isn\u2019t easy to figure out, even for cloud experts, but it\u2019s critically necessary to protect applications and data,\u201d said CSC CEO Toshihiro Koike. \u201cRecently, WAF operation has become one of the most talked about topics in Japan. We\u2019re confident that CSC\u2019s U.S. customers will be extremely satisfied with WafCharm, which is used by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Japan, who rightfully demands consistent, high quality services.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAmong the developers surveyed, 85% said that their own team or their boss was typically held responsible for successful cyber attacks. And the stress they experienced was real: Over a third reported developing unhealthy habits from the impact of managing cloud or web applications, including drinking more alcohol, oversleeping, fighting more with family or friends, grinding their teeth at night, or overeating and eating unhealthy foods.\n</p><p>\n\u201cUsing WafCharm can reduce the stress, frustration, and blame that teams experience in a very concrete way,\u201d added Koike. \u201cIt solves a major, real-world pain point. Companies won\u2019t have to designate a security engineer just for managing WAF operation. And we\u2019ve never had a case where a customer canceled WafCharm due to dissatisfaction. With this major release, I am very much looking forward to U.S. customers using WafCharm and experiencing the superb quality of the product. WAF has become an indispensable part of cybersecurity strategy for businesses of every size and across every vertical, and optimizing its rules is essential to its successful use.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<b>Enterprise-Grade Release Offers Ease of Use, U.S.-Based Reps and Affordable Pricing</b>\n</p><p>\nWhile CSC headquarters is located in Tokyo, with this release, the company is now offering U.S.-based customer service representatives. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wafcharm.com%2Fen%2F%23service_plans&amp;esheet=52521258&amp;newsitemid=20211104005290&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Affordable+pricing&amp;index=2&amp;md5=9e25ae4d09d1d8f61fcdf8c054f7bc6f\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Affordable pricing</a> is tiered for individuals, SMBs and enterprises, and easy payment options include credit card or invoice payment.
