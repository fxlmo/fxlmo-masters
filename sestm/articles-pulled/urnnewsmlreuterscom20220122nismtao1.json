We think this robot vacuum is iRobot's best Roomba yet\u00a0thanks to its\u00a0excellent navigation and cleaning capabilities. In testing, the j7+ easily maneuvered around furniture and (yes) dog poop and picked up just as much dirt as a full-sized vacuum.\u00a0</p><p><span>Save up to 39% on iRobot Roomba j7+ and j7 Robot Vacuums</span> </p><p><big>2.

Up to 50% off: Some of our favorite tablets</big> </p><p>The best tablets available don't come cheap, but right now you can get one of our favorites for less than $140. Amazon's Fire HD 10 usually starts from $179.99, but you can get one with a 32 gigabyte capacity for 22% off right now, bringing the price down to $139.99. We ranked the Fire HD 10 as one of the best tablets we've ever tested thanks to its large display, which is capable of playing 1080p-resolution videos with reasonably true colors and black levels, and the relatively quick charging time. Though it doesn't have the strongest app collection compared with the competition from Apple and Google, it's hard to beat its current discounted price.
