Any response to the proposals should be made only on the basis of the information in the formal documentation to follow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Overseas jurisdictions</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable requirements.

Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of abrdn and interactive investor about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and the events discussed herein may not occur.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on abrdn and interactive investor or the Enlarged Group (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"projects\", \"strategy\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Although abrdn and interactive investor believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, abrdn and interactive investor can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they are based on information available at the time they are made, including current expectations and assumptions, and relate to future events and/or depend on circumstances which may be or are beyond the abrdn Group's control, including among other things: UK domestic and global political, economic and business conditions (such as the UK's exit from the EU); market related risks such as fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, and the performance of financial markets generally; the impact of inflation and deflation; the impact of competition; the timing, impact and other uncertainties associated with future acquisitions, disposals or combinations undertaken by abrdn or its affiliates and/or within relevant industries; the value of and earnings from the abrdn Group's strategic investments and ongoing commercial relationships; default by counterparties; information technology or data security breaches (including the abrdn Group being subject to cyberattacks); operational information technology risks, including the abrdn Group's operations being highly dependent on its information technology systems (both internal and outsourced); natural or man made catastrophic events; the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; climate change and a transition to a low carbon economy (including the risk that</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>the abrdn Group may not achieve its targets); exposure to third party risks including as a result of outsourcing; the failure to attract or retain necessary key personnel; the policies and actions of regulatory authorities; and the impact of changes in capital, solvency or accounting standards, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which abrdn and its affiliates operate.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither abrdn and interactive investor, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither abrdn nor interactive investor is under any obligation, and abrdn and interactive investor expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified financial benefits statement for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for the Enlarged Group, abrdn and/or interactive investor for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share of abrdn or interactive investor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rounding</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Certain figures included in this announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments.

Morgan Securities plc, which conducts its UK investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove (\"J.P. Morgan Cazenove\"), and which is authorised in the United Kingdom by the Prudential Regulation Authority (the \"PRA\") and regulated by the PRA and the FCA, is acting as financial adviser exclusively for abrdn and no one else in connection with the Acquisition and will not regard any other person as its client in relation to the Acquisition and will not be responsible to anyone other than interactive investor for providing the protections afforded to clients of J.P. Morgan Cazenove or its affiliates, nor for providing advice in relation to the Acquisition or any other matter or arrangement referred to herein.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>LEI number of abrdn plc: 0TMBS544NMO7GLCE7H90</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>APPENDIX I</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Principal agreements in connection with the Acquisition</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>SPA</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>\n</span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>interactive investor is the holding company of the interactive investor Group. Currently, c.95.2 per cent. of interactive investor's shares are held by Antler Holdco Limited (\"Antler\"), a Guernsey-incorporated company controlled by J.C. Flowers IV L.P. (the \"J.C. Flowers Fund\").</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>On 2 December 2021, abrdn and the Initial Sellers entered into the SPA to give effect to the Acquisition. The Initial Sellers include the J.C. Flowers Fund, MMC and key members of interactive investor's management team, Richard Wilson (Chief Executive Officer), Barry Bicknell (Chief Finance Officer), John Tumilty (Chief Technology Officer) and Gary Shaw (Director of Operations) (together, the \"Management Sellers\"). The Initial Sellers own the majority of the issued share capital in Antler.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Pursuant to the SPA, the Initial Sellers have agreed to sell their shares in Antler to abrdn. After the signing of the SPA and before Completion: (i) the Management Sellers have agreed to take certain steps (and the J.C. Flowers Fund and MMC have agreed, if necessary, to invoke their drag rights) to transfer the shares of the other Antler shareholders to abrdn; and (ii) J.C. Flowers and the Management Sellers have agreed to procure that Antler takes certain steps (including, if necessary, by invoking its drag rights) to transfer the c.4.8 per cent. of the shares of interactive investor held by minority shareholders to Antler.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Consideration</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The purchase price for 100 per cent. of the Antler shares and all of the c.4.8 per cent. minority shares in interactive investor is \u00a31.49 billion in cash. The purchase price is subject to: (i) a locked box adjustment from 30 September 2021; and (ii) a regulatory capital adjustment, which is equal to two times the difference between the actual minimum regulatory capital requirement as at 31 March 2022 and \u00a348 million. The maximum regulatory capital adjustment (in either direction) will be \u00a320 million. As a result, the total deal consideration will be in the range of \u00a31.47 billion to \u00a31.51 billion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Antler has outstanding discount notes in issue, which will be redeemed at Completion. The redemption amount will be funded by abrdn and will be deducted from the purchase price to be paid by abrdn at Completion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Conditions and break fee</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Completion under the SPA is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including: the approval of the Acquisition by abrdn Shareholders at the General Meeting to be convened pursuant to the notice of meeting to be set out in the Circular</span>\n<span>(the \"Shareholder Approval Condition\"); the approval of the FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority; and certain material adverse events not having occurred in respect of the interactive investor Group by Completion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The SPA requires that abrdn ensures that its directors provide a unanimous recommendation to its shareholders to approve the Acquisition. This obligation is subject to a carve-out allowing the directors not to provide such recommendation (or to withdraw such recommendation once made) if required by the directors' fiduciary duties. However, if the Shareholder Approval Condition has not been satisfied by the longstop date in circumstances where the directors have exercised their right to withhold or withdraw their recommendation of the Acquisition to its shareholders, abrdn would be required to pay a break fee of \u00a37.5 million in cash to the Initial Sellers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Warranties, and</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>warranty and indemnity insurance</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The SPA contains title and capacity warranties. The liability of the Initial Sellers for any breach of warranty under the SPA is subject to customary limitations and exclusions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Management Warrantors have agreed to give fundamental and business warranties under a separate Management Warranty Deed. The Management Warrantors' liability for any breach of these warranties is limited by (among other things) an aggregate financial cap of \u00a31, which is customary for deals with warranty and indemnity insurance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The warranties under the Management Warranty Deed and the SPA are backed by warranty and indemnity insurance. The liability of the insurers under the warranty and indemnity insurance is subject to further limitations and exclusions in addition to those contained in the Management Warranty Deed and the SPA. In particular, there is an overall cap on liability of \u00a3375 million.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>APPENDIX II</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND BASES OF CALCULATION</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In this Announcement, unless otherwise stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>All financial information presented other than financial information in respect of the abrdn Group, reflects reported results for interactive investor, which is the holding company of the interactive investor Group.
