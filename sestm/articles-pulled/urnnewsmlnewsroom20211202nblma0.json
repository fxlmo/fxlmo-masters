This year's quarter was negatively impacted by\nthe reduction of one customer account starting late first quarter of fiscal\n2021 and the continued reduction in driver count due to turnover and the\ndriver shortage (down ~100 drivers from the 4th quarter of last year)\nlargely offset by improved transportation freight rates and higher fuel\nsurcharges. Transportation revenues (excluding fuel surcharges) were\n$18,244,000, down $2,068,000 or 10%. Revenue miles were down 1,368,000, or\n20%, over the same quarter last year. Transportation revenue per mile was\nup $.36, or 12.2%, due to an improved business mix and rate increases. Fuel\nsurcharge revenue was $2,213,000, up $1,159,000 from the same quarter last\nyear.\n\n     Compensation and benefits decreased $212,000, mainly due to the lower\ndriver count, a reduction in support wages partially offset by our\nincreased driver compensation package (approximately 15% effective April\n29, 2021). Gross fuel expense increased $350,000 as a result of higher cost\nper gallon. Insurance and losses decreased $452,000, primarily from lower\nhealth care claims and lower risk insurance claims. Depreciation expense\nwas down $203,000 in the quarter as we continue to reduce our fleet size.\nSG&amp;A expense was higher by $196,000 resulting from a $190,000 one time gain\nrelated to the Danfair acquisition included in last year's quarter. Loss on\ndisposition of assets was ($26,000) versus a gain of $100,000 in the same\nquarter last year.\n\n     As a result, operating profit this quarter was $58,000 compared to\n$761,000 in the same quarter last year. Operating ratio was 99.7 this\nquarter versus 96.4 the same quarter last year.\n\n     Operating Results for Fiscal year 2021\n\n     The Company reported net income of $625,000, or $.18 per share,\ncompared to $257,000, or $.08 per share last year. Net income this year\nincluded $1,170,000, or $.34 per share, from gains on real estate sales net\nof income taxes.\n\n     Total revenues for the period were $81,268,000, down $7,445,000 from\nthe same period last year, of which $5,444,000 resulted from the downsizing\nof one customer account beginning late first quarter and the remainder of\nthe revenue variance was primarily attributable to the declining driver\ncount. Transportation revenues (excluding fuel surcharges) were\n$74,431,000, down $8,072,000 or 10%. Revenue miles were down 4,598,000, or\n16%, over the same period last year. Transportation revenue per mile was up\n$.22, or 7.6%, due to an improved business mix and rate increases. Fuel\nsurcharge revenue was $6,837,000, up $627,000 from the same period last\nyear.\n\n     Compensation and benefits decreased $3,228,000, mainly due to lower\ncompany miles, as well as the elimination of minimum driver pay expense and\nreductions in non-driver support positions. Gross fuel expense decreased\n$667,000 due to lower company miles. Repairs and tire expense decreased\n$538,000 due to lower miles this year. Insurance and losses decreased\n$1,379,000, primarily from lower health care claims. Depreciation expense\nwas down $729,000 as we continue to reduce our fleet size to meet our\nbusiness levels. SG&amp;A expense was lower by $172,000 resulting primarily\nfrom permanent cost reductions. Corporate expenses were down $178,000 due\nmainly to lower compensation expense, legal and audit fees. Gain on sale of\nland was $1,614,000 due to the sale of our former terminal location in\nPensacola, FL and the sale and partial leaseback of our terminal in\nChattanooga, TN. Loss on disposition of assets was $179,000 (primarily due\nto $243,000 of write offs on the equipment involved in two tractor rollover\naccidents) versus a gain of $774,000 last year. Total expense associated\nwith the 2 roll over accidents, including the equipment write-offs, was\n$879,500.\n\n     As a result, operating profit was $880,000 compared to $243,000 in the\nsame period last year. Excluding the gain on sale of terminal sites and the\nnegative impacts of the rollover accidents, operating profit for the fiscal\nyear was $145,500. Operating ratio was 98.9 versus 99.7 last year.\n\n     Summary and Outlook\n\n     The early part of this fiscal year we began downsizing one customer\naccount, primarily due to rates, and saw additional driver declines as the\nimpacts of the driver shortage and high turnover continued to plague us.\nHeading into the 3rd quarter we determined that the driver shortage and\nhigh turnover was unsustainable and that a driver pay increase was\nimperative if we were going to continue to provide service to our\ncustomers. On April 29th, we implemented a significant driver pay increase\n(15%+). We went to all of our customers and proposed a rate increase to\ncompletely offset the impacts of the pay increase and all but one very\nsmall account accepted the rate increase. Many other customers who were due\nfor a rate increase also accepted an added increase on top of that required\nto cover the driver pay. Most of these increases were implemented during\nthe month of May with some starting in June and were fully flowing through\nin the 4th quarter. We completed the rate increase negotiations with our\nlargest account, most of which were implemented across the fourth quarter.\nWe are currently discussing additional rate increases with most customers\nthat we plan to implement during this first quarter to continue to allow us\nto make improvements to driver pay and offset the rising cost of risk\ninsurance premiums. We fully expect to continue pushing prices in the\ncoming years in order to improve operating profit.\n\n     The impact of the driver pay increase has been beneficial,\nspecifically on retention where we have seen an ~35% reduction in voluntary\nturnover following the announcement. We have seen an uptick on the\napplication and hiring side in the 4th quarter, however still well below\npre-Covid levels, and continue to press forward through targeted\nadvertisements and using our drivers to promote the compensation package\nwith referral bonuses. Overall, the net result thus far is that we are\nmaintaining our driver count fairly level since April, losing ~3 net\ndrivers a month, versus losing 10-12 net drivers per month previously. The\npast several weeks we have seen an uptick in the number of drivers in\ntraining (~35% higher) and we saw net driver growth in 3 of the past 4\nweeks adding 9 drivers to the fleet. We also just announced additional\nsignificant driver pay increases in both Atlanta (15%) and Nashville (~12%)\nand are working to form longer term strategic partnerships with select\ncustomers in those markets, raise rates to offset the pay increase and grow\nour driver counts to allow us to grow with those customers and add margin.\nThe supply chain challenges have certainly made news recently and we\ncontinue to be creative in our approach to attracting, hiring and retaining\ndrivers including our recent completion of the Department of Labor\nRegistered Apprenticeship application to become part of the Federal\nprogram.\n\n     Our balance sheet remained solid with $10.9 million of cash and cash\nequivalents as of September 30, 2021, and no outstanding debt. We will\nstart replacing tractors in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 with\nplans to buy 30 replacement tractors and a handful of trailers putting our\ncurrent planned capital expenditures at ~$6,000,000 for fiscal year 2022.\n\n     Subsequent Events\n\n     Tampa Land Sale\n\n     On October 18, 2021, we completed the disposition of the Company's\nterminal located in Tampa, Florida to Amazon.com Services LLC for a sale\nprice of $9,600,000. The Company anticipates that the sale will result in\nan after-tax gain of approximately $6,287,000.\n\n     Dividend\n\n     On October 25th, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a\nspecial cash dividend of $3.75 per share, or approximately $12,800,000 in\nthe aggregate, on the Company's outstanding common stock. This one-time,\nspecial dividend was paid to shareholders on November 15, 2021. Over the\npast two years, we have returned $9.90 per share to our shareholders in the\nform of dividends. Immediately following the dividend our cash balance was\napproximately $6.5 million and our $15 million revolving credit facility\nhad only $1.6 million outstanding for letters of credit.\n\n     Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n     The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have some impact on demand for oil\nand petroleum products in certain markets but, mainly due to the rollout of\nthe vaccine, that impact was far less in this quarter than had been\nexperienced since the beginning of the pandemic. As an essential business,\nwe have continued to operate throughout the pandemic in accordance with CDC\nguidance and orders issued by state and local authorities.\n\n     Conference Call\n\n     The Company will host a conference call on December 2, 2021 at 3:00 PM\n(EDT).
