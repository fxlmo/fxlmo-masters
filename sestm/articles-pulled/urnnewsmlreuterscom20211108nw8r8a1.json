Most recently, he was CEO of eCommerce startup Hollar, where he revitalized product merchandising, product development, consumer marketing, and more, leading to accelerated growth and eventual sale to Five Below in 2020. Prior to Hollar, Oliver was COO of Ticketfly, where he directly oversaw the product, engineering, marketing, client &amp; customer support, and HR teams, leading to the company\u2019s sale to Pandora in 2015 and subsequent sale to Eventbrite in 2017. Oliver is also a nine-year veteran of Amazon, where he was instrumental in the rapid growth of the company\u2019s Canadian presence as well as in the evolution of Amazon Video.\n</p><p>\n\u201cCharlie and Keith have built and fostered an environment at Boosted that is committed to optimizing our portfolio of brands for long-term, sustainable growth,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI\u2019ve already been inspired by the team\u2019s desire to integrate modern, forward-thinking solutions that enable us to better navigate the operational complexities of building a business.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThe breadth and depth of Oliver\u2019s experiences in his more than 17 years in the industry have made him uniquely suited to play a fundamental role in Boosted\u2019s increasingly rapid growth. His hire, on the heels of the recent hiring of Chief Technology Officer Juan Paul Ramirez, further accelerates Boosted\u2019s ability to build world-class brands. In 2021 alone, Boosted has seen explosive expansion, having grown its team nearly 4x and revenue more than 100x. Oliver intends to harness this momentum by continuing to build out the team and further position Boosted as an industry leader in supply chain management, product marketing, and data.\n</p><p>\n\u201cSteve couldn\u2019t be a better fit for the Boosted team,\u201d said Boosted\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, Keith Richman. \u201cNot only is he fluent in Amazon\u2019s operations, but his diverse background within the industry -- from growing an eCommerce startup like Hollar to leading Amazon Canada to becoming the number one eCommerce store in the country -- has equipped him with an incredible mastery of the eCommerce ecosystem. Steve has proven that he is always thinking 10 steps ahead, preparing, innovating, and optimizing companies for whatever is coming next. His strategic vision will be an incredible asset to us and our brands.\u201d\n</p><p>\nIf you\u2019re interested in joining the team, or want to learn more, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fboostedcommerce.com%2F&amp;esheet=52524558&amp;newsitemid=20211108005449&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=boostedcommerce.com&amp;index=2&amp;md5=dcc354d6ffc01555f895492423326954\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">boostedcommerce.com</a>.\n</p><p>\n<b>About Boosted Commerce</b>\n</p><p>\nBoosted Commerce buys and grows high quality commerce brands.
