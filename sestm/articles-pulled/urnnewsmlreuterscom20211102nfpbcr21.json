Rowe Price, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, Third Point, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment and Soros Fund Management \u00a0Amazon, which already has a 20% stake after leading a US$2.5bn funding round in July, is putting in US$200m of that sum.</p>\n              <p>Rivian is also setting aside another 7% of the offering for eligible US customers with a standing pre-order.</p>\n              <p>The company, founded by MIT-trained mechanical engineer\u00a0Robert Scaringe in 2009, has preorders for 55,400 of its R1T model and R1S model in the US and Canada from customers that have paid a US$1,000 deposit.</p>\n              <p>The R1T is a two-row five-passenger pickup truck and the R1S a three-row seven-passenger SUV.\u00a0But essentially underwriting Rivian\u2019s near-term revenues, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans in\u00a0the largest EV order ever.</p>\n              <p>Rivian began deliveries of the R1Ts in September (and has now delivered 156 of them), and expects to have produced 1,200 of the former and 25 R1Ss by the end of this year.</p>\n              <p>The offering leads an already overflowing November IPO calendar that includes at least 17 live US IPOs seeking to raise nearly US$12bn.</p>\n              <p>The IPO also looks well-timed alongside the renewed surge in the shares of Elon Musk's Tesla, which is taking orders for its cybertruck (ahead of production next year) and has taken legal action against Rivian in a dispute over trade secrets.</p>\n              <p>(Anthony Hughes; Editing by Stephen Lacey)</p>\n              <p>((anthony.hughes@refinitiv.com; (646) 552-4852))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
