Better access to a plethora of songs and albums from their favorite artists? Maybe a convenient way to play\u00a0all that music throughout the house? You don't have to choose, since right now\u00a0Amazon is offering a\u00a0deal that covers both.</p><p><span><span>Tackle your holiday shopping with deals and expert advice delivered straight to your phone.</span> Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting team at Reviewed.</span> </p><p>Through\u00a0 <span>Friday, December 31</span> , the online shopping outlet is offering newcomers to its Amazon Music Unlimited service the third-generation Echo Dot smart speaker (now $19.99)\u00a0for just $0.99. That means regular customers would pay $9.99 ($7.99 for Prime members) for the AMU access and get the puck-shaped speaker for a whopping 98% off the $39.99 list price.\u00a0Normally this package would run you a total of $49.98 ($47.98 for Prime customers) for one month of AMU access, but through the end of the year\u00a0the holiday bundle will only cost you $10.98.</p><p>The features of Amazon Music Unlimited make the service enticing on its own. We named it one of our favorite music streamers, having impressed us with its\u00a0access to more than 70 million songs\u00a0on demand without ad interruption\u2014they can even be\u00a0downloaded to your device for offline playback. In addition to tunes galore, the Unlimited version of the service\u00a0boasts\u00a0plenty of on-demand podcasts, all of which will come completely free of\u00a0ads.</p><p>As for the Echo Dot, we think\u00a0it's\u00a0a solid entry into the world of smart speakers.\u00a0Though it's smaller\u00a0than its newer brethren (now at $29.99), the third-generation Dot is still one of the best Echo speakers for giving you access to all standard Alexa features at a fraction of the cost of the rest of the Echo series. Its compact design also makes it a great fit for anywhere in your home, from a tiny corner on your office desk to a bit of space between your coffee maker and your toaster on your kitchen counter.\u00a0</p><p>It's tough enough to find one great gift during the holidays, so why not get two for the price of one?
