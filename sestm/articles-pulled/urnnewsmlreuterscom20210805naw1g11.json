It was launched with a goal of bettering business practices across the board.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWe are delighted with this recognition of our efforts, working with many leading global industrial customers, to help drive a more sustainable future through digital transformation. \u00a0Over the past year we were able to help our industrial customers to successfully navigate the short-term challenges of the pandemic and moving forward our continued goal is to create innovative solutions to help them achieve their digitalization goals,\u201d commented Peter Herweck CEO, AVEVA.</p>\n<p>While digital transformation remains at the core of customers\u2019 decisions to adopt AVEVA\u2019s solutions, the company is also making a strong contribution to sustainability through its products. For example, the remote deployment of AVEVA Unified Operations Centre has enabled Saudi Aramco to monitor emissions and optimize energy usage; while Neste, the world\u2019s leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, is using AVEVA\u2019s Unified Supply Chain to drive collaboration between its remote teams, boosting efficiency. Similarly, several of AVEVA\u2019s EPC customers are using \u00a0AVEVA\u2122 Unified Engineering to help pioneer hydrogen production designs while other engineering companies use the software for onshore windfarms. AVEVA has also seen increased demand in the Food &amp; Beverage sector for its Manufacturing Execution software.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoving forward, AVEVA has a strong springboard for the future long-term growth of the business, and we are optimally positioned to support customers in their digitalization journey and in creating more sustainable and resilient businesses. The acquisition of OSIsoft, earlier this year, established AVEVA as a clear global leader in operational industrial software, further enhancing our ability to drive the digital transformation of the industrial world, with a more diversified customer base, supporting their energy transition and sustainability journey\u2019s. Our software is playing a key role in helping organizations to address both their immediate and future digital needs and our continued strong all-round performance, is a testimony of AVEVA\u2019s successful execution of its long-term vision,\u201d concluded Herweck.</p>\n<div><b><span>Send us your press releases to</span>\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com</a></b></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnote-disclaimer\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
