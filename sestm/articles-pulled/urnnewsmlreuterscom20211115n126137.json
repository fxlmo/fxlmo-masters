Data-center operator CyrusOne <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=CONE.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"CONE.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">CONE.O</a>, which counts giants like Microsoft <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MSFT.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MSFT.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MSFT.O</a> and Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> as customers, on Monday said it had <a href=\"https://investor.cyrusone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cyrusone-be-acquired-kkr-and-global-infrastructure-partners-15\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">landed</a> a $15 billion sale to private equity firms KKR <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=KKR.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"KKR.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">KKR.N</a> and Global Infrastructure Partners. The same day, peer CoreSite Realty <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=COR.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"COR.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">COR.N</a> <a href=\"https://americantower.gcs-web.com/node/24701/pdf\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">inked</a> a $10 billion sale to American Tower <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMT.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMT.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMT.N</a> as both look to service the growing fleet of connected devices. These deals show the different ways buyers are preparing for Silicon Valley\u2019s new virtual reality. </p><p>Buyout giant Blackstone <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=BX.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"BX.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">BX.N</a> set the scene when it bought QTS Realty Trust in June. That deal\u2019s hefty valuation, at around 25 times forward EBITDA, looked rich, but KKR has just about matched it, and American Tower is paying an even higher multiple. QTS, CyrusOne and CoreSite all host servers that help companies wrangle data sloshing around the cloud. Autonomous cars, industrial tracking devices and augmented-reality applications are among the innovations fueling the future need for data processing.</p><p>On one side of these new developments are the technology titans. Facebook\u2019s parent company has rebranded to Meta Platforms <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=FB.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"FB.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FB.O</a> as it refocuses on developing virtual worlds; Microsoft, too, has pitched its take on moving meetings into digital spaces. CyrusOne is heavily dependent on these few, large customers. For financial buyers, that can be a positive: They can simply deploy their vast war chests of cash to grow capacity in line with their clients. </p><p>On the other side are companies like American Tower that operate communications infrastructure. Since they already help ship data from one place to another, their hope is that by expanding into data centers like the ones CoreSite runs, they can serve a wider group of geographically disparate customers where they are. This is something a financial buyer cannot do. </p><p>As excitement over swelling pools of data has grown, deal valuations have risen, but the number of acquisition targets has shrunk. The nearly $6 billion Switch <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=SWCH.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"SWCH.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">SWCH.N</a>, where activist Elliott Management sits on the board, is one of the few publicly traded data-center operators, and looks lonely compared to remaining stand-alone giants like $44 billion Digital Realty Trust <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=DLR.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"DLR.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">DLR.N</a> and $72 billion Equinix <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=EQIX.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"EQIX.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">EQIX.O</a>. It may be one of the last invitees to the virtual party. </p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JMAGuilford\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@JMAGuilford</a> on Twitter</p><p><br/></p><p>CONTEXT NEWS</p><p>- CyrusOne said on Nov. 15 that it had agreed to be acquired by private equity firm KKR for $90.50 per share, or around $15 billion in total including the U.S. data-center operator\u2019s debt.</p><p>- The price is a 25% premium to CyrusOne\u2019s undisturbed market value, the company said. Reuters had reported in September that the company was exploring a sale.</p><p>- American Tower said on the same day that it would buy CoreSite Realty, another U.S. data-center company, for $170 per share, equivalent to $7.5 billion, in cash. Including CoreSite\u2019s debt, the deal is worth $10.1 billion.</p><p>- CoreSite runs 25 data centers and makes annual revenue of $655 million, based on the third-quarter numbers, with EBITDA of $343 million.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Editing by John Foley and Amanda Gomez)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">((For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=GUILFORD/\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"GUILFORD/\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">GUILFORD/</a> <br/> SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href=\"https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe</a> | <a href=\"mailto:Jonathan.Guilford@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Jonathan.Guilford@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; Reuters Messaging: Jonathan.Guilford. <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://karen.kwok.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
