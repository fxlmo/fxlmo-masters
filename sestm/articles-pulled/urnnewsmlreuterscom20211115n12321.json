Renewable energy requires <span class=\"tr-strong\">producers</span> to know their <span class=\"tr-strong\">output </span>at various locations at different times.</p><p>\"As they transition to energy companies, it makes it easier for them, because they have all their wind data and their solar data, transmission line data, all this in there as well,\" Vass said.</p><p>\"You'd really don't have a concept of how complicated the energy grid actually is until you start looking at all these different ways\" of transmitting energy.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by Richard Chang)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:Stephen.Nellis@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Stephen.Nellis@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; (415) 344-4934; ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
