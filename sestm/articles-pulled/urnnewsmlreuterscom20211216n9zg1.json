Clumio Protect for Amazon S3 is a backup as a service (BaaS) offering that provides added protection against ransomware, simplified compliance reporting, and a low recovery time objective (RTO), while at the same time reducing the cost to protect data in Amazon S3. Since the announcement of its early access (EA) program in September, Clumio has successfully performed thousands of backups for EA customers.<br/></p><p align=\"justify\"><span>\u201cNow that customers have seen it in action and experienced how truly simple it is for them to protect their mission critical datasets in Amazon S3, the reception we have received for Clumio Protect for Amazon S3 has exceeded our expectations,\u201d said Chadd Kenney, Vice President of Product, Clumio. \u201cCustomers love how quickly they can protect their data from ransomware and that they can recover it in seconds. You know you have delivered something special when one of your biggest customers tells you \u2013 I\u2019m very happy with this product, I couldn\u2019t have designed it better myself.\u201d</span></p><p align=\"justify\">EA customers report the following initial results:</p><ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify\"><strong>Quick and effortless ransomware protection:</strong> EA customers experienced easy onboarding through the Clumio Protect listing in AWS Marketplace. <span>\u201cWe were able to start protecting our Amazon S3 data in less than ten minutes,\u201d said Francisco Borge, CTO, Birdzi. \u201cOur data is now immutable in Clumio SecureVault and protected against access by ransomware, bad actors, and other threats.\u201d</span></li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify\"><strong>Low RTO with one-click rapid recovery:</strong> Customers can recover critical Amazon S3 data with a single click. Combined with global search functionality that works across backups, buckets, and accounts, <span>recovery time was reduced significantly.</span> One customer was able to recover terabytes of data stored across multiple buckets in less than three minutes, which otherwise would have taken hours.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify\"><strong>Cloud scale:</strong> Based on a serverless architecture, Clumio\u2019s data protection platform scales to meet the backup demands of its largest customers. During the EA period, Clumio Protect for Amazon S3 <span>backed up 100s of terabytes of data across more than 100 million Amazon S3 objects</span>. <span>\u201cWe were searching for a backup solution for our critical Amazon S3 data that was easy to use without any complex planning involved,\u201d said Tyler Wood, Director of IT, Bidadoo. \u201cClumio Protect for Amazon S3 met our requirements and exceeded expectations. The platform feature set, service, and support has been amazing.\u201d</span><br/></li></ul><p align=\"justify\"><span>\u201cWe have been innovating at a rapid pace in the public cloud and optimally protecting our mission-critical data in Amazon S3 is a challenge,\u201d said Mark Huber, Senior Director, Engineering Enablement at Cox Automotive. \u201cOur Amazon S3 data is immense and diverse. We originally planned to build our own backup solution, but the effort was massive. Clumio listened to our feedback and tirelessly worked with our teams to deliver Clumio Protect for Amazon S3. We can selectively provide the right levels of protection for our Amazon S3 data via global policies and protection groups. Global search enables quick recovery of any bucket or object for compliance needs, and optimizations to reduce small object overhead and deliver a low TCO.\u201d</span></p><p align=\"justify\">With digital transformation continuing to gather momentum, more and more customers leverage Amazon S3 for durable storage. As datasets in Amazon S3 scale, customers need to to track what types of data they have, determine what needs to be protected, and prove compliance with the data protection policies of the business.</p><p align=\"justify\"><span>\u201cAs customers migrate more applications to AWS, they look to add additional protection for their most important data, which is often stored in Amazon S3,\u201d said Kevin Miller, Vice President &amp; General Manager, Amazon S3 at Amazon Web Services (AWS).\u00a0\u201cClumio Protect for Amazon S3 helps customers to protect their data by enforcing retention periods across buckets, providing fast recovery options when a restore is needed, and monitoring to verify compliance with data protection policies. We\u2019re excited about how\u00a0Clumio\u2019s service can help customers preserve the integrity of critical datasets, and look forward to our continued work together.\u201d</span></p><p align=\"justify\">Clumio Protect for Amazon S3 key benefits include:</p><ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li style=\"margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify\"><strong>Ransomware and bad actor protection: </strong>Clumio Protect\u2019s Amazon S3 backups are stored outside of the customer\u2019s AWS account, so that they are completely separated from the production environment.
