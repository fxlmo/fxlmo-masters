Fitch said the company's management remains committed to an investment-grade rating.</p><p>The company raised about USD9 billion in financial year ended March 2020 (FY20) and FY21 via equity issuance, selling a stake in subsidiary Airtel Africa Plc and the sale-and-leaseback of towers in Africa.</p><p>The management aspires to achieve a debt/EBITDA ratio of around 2x in the long term.</p><p>Fitch forecast Bharti's capex to increase to about USD5 billion in FY22 of which USD1.5 billion is likely to be paid upfront to acquire 5G spectrum assets.</p><p>\"We believe that the company will also seek to strengthen its fibre infrastructure -- connecting towers with fibre and backhaul infrastructure to prepare its network to launch 5G services in 2022-23. Capex on 5G infrastructure during 2022-23 will replace 4G investments as 4G coverage is largely complete.\"</p><p>Fitch said it expects Bharti's main shareholders -- Bharti Telecom and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd -- will collectively subscribe to their full entitlement in Bharti's rights issue.</p><p>Singtel has yet to announce its exact subscription. \"However, we estimate Singtel's equity participation over a three-year period to be about USD400 million, based on its 14 per cent direct stake in Bharti.\"</p><p>Fitch said these investments underscore strategic importance of the Indian telecoms business to Singtel.
