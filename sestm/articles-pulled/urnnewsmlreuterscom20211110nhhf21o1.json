A great example is the iRobot Roomba i6+, on sale now for $549.99\u2014that's a 31% discount from its regular price of $799.99. The i6+ is one of our favorite Roombas for having similar dirt pickup and self-emptying mechanisms as our all-time favorite, the Roomba i7+ ($599.99), while currently being more affordable (note, however that the i6+ doesn't come with the spare filter and extra bags that the i7+ does).\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the iRobot Roomba i6+ for $549.99 (Save $250)</span> </p><p><big>3.\u00a0As much as 32% off: Some of our favorite exercise machines</big> </p><p>Bring your exercise indoors with savings on two different fitness machines from NordicTrack. The NordicTrack 1750 commercial treadmill is on sale for $1,599, a $400 savings from its normal $1,999 list price. The 1750 is the best treadmill we've ever tried, wowing us with its incredible range of speed (between 0.5 miles per hour to 12 mph) and incline (-3% to 15%, which even lets it simulate going downhill). Our tester said it was a \"joy\" to run on the 1750, with an \"ideal springiness-to-firmness ratio\" that she felt protected her joints without making her feel like she would run off the machine itself. The 22-inch NordicTrack S22i commercial studio cycle is also on sale for $1,499, a $700 drop from its regular $2,199 price. The S22i is one of our favorite exercise bikes, having impressed our tester with its ability to automatically adjust both its electromagnetic resistance and incline.\u00a0</p><p><span>Save as much as 32% on NordicTrack exercise machines</span> </p><p><big>4.\u00a0Less than $20: This customizable hair clipper</big> </p><p>Keep your hair in line without visiting the barber's chair with the Wahl Color pro clipper and trimmer, on sale for $18.37.
