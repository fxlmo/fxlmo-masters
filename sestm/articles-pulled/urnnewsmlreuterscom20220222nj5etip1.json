Staub Cast Iron 4-Quart Round Cocotte</big> </p><p>If you're looking for some reliable cookware to add to your kitchen, consider the Staub cast iron cocotte. Normally listed for $130.89, this 4-quart round Dutch oven with a glass lid can be yours for as low as $99.95 in cherry red, black and white. We named the larger Staub cast iron 5.5-quart round cocotte (from $324.95) the best Dutch oven we've ever tested, so this smaller model is sure to impress with the tempered glass lid for optimal heat control and a multi-coat enamel\u2014which the brand claims is resistant to chips, scratches and discoloration. The pot is designed for searing, boiling, deep-frying, braising and more in the oven, and works on both induction and traditional stovetops.</p><p><span>Get the Staub Cast Iron 4-Quart Round Cocotte from $99.95 (Save $5.62 to $107.65)</span> </p><p><big>2.\u00a0Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows</big> </p><p>Sleep soundly with a new set of Beckham Hotel Collection bed pillows, the best affordable pillows we've ever tested.

Philips Premium Air Fryer XXL</big> </p><p>Air fryers make cooking a whole lot easier, but some of the best models can be pretty pricey. Fortunately, our favorite air fryer, the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL, is currently selling at as much as 43% off at Amazon. Typically listed for $349.95, you can get the 4-quart fryer in black for just $199.95. In testing, we were impressed with this model's large capacity and loved that it made crispy foods (including family-size portions) without preheating. Although this air fryer doesn't have digital controls, making it harder to precisely set the temperature and cooking time, we still found it to be the most user-friendly air fryer we tested.\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL for $199.95 (Save $136 to $150)</span> </p><p><big>5. iRobot Roomba i3</big> </p><p>With spring just around the corner, it's time to start thinking about spring cleaning\u2014or, rather, how you'll make spring cleaning easier on yourself.
