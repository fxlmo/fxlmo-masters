This announcement comes on the heels of a recent announcement of a $6M Seed Series raise led by Madrona Venture Group, Decibel, and a who\u2019s who of PNW SaaS executives.\n</p><p>\nJacob (his preferred name) leads Magnify\u2019s engineering and product teams, helping to bring to life the vision of automating and personalizing the customer experience for software through code.\n</p><p>\nJacob brings a depth of experience in automation, enterprise software, and building successful engineering teams to Magnify. He was recently at Amazon where he was a GM and Head of Engineering, leading large global engineering and product teams that worked on digital commerce platforms and new products in Devices &amp; Services. During his 8-year tenure at Amazon, he led cross-disciplinary teams across engineering, product, and applied science on problems spanning e-commerce lifecycle, content moderation, risk/fraud detection, analytics and product growth. Before Amazon, Jacob spent his professional career in the enterprise world, which included being one of the early members on the Microsoft Azure team, helping architect and migrate multi-billion dollar products like Office and Windows to the cloud, and leading engineering efforts for Fortune 500 companies across several verticals.\n</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about Magnify and our mission to transform the customer experience in software through automation. Over the last couple of decades, the industry has moved from Data silos to BI to AI. We live in a world where \u2018data-driven<span>\u2019</span> decision making is the standard but processing that data to extract insights and actions still requires humans. Without the help of AI-powered orchestration of the customer experience, enterprise product and customer success teams struggle to react quickly to customer needs while drowning in data and BI spreadsheets. We need to evolve to AI-driven orchestration and do this at scale across verticals--essentially, \u2018AI as a Service.\u2019 Magnify\u2019s vision is exactly that in the post-sales enterprise software space,\u201d commented Jacob.\n</p><p>\nMagnify CEO and co-founder, Josh Crossman adds, \u201cJacob is a proven, world-class technology leader with the very rare and special combination of cutting-edge technical insight, enterprise software experience, and values-driven leadership. I\u2019m looking forward to collaborating with him to build our product and technical teams, and more importantly, partnering to build a remarkable company.\u201d\n</p><p>\nMagnify is <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magnify.io%2Fopportunities&amp;esheet=52546053&amp;newsitemid=20211207005424&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=actively+hiring&amp;index=2&amp;md5=fe0ec1220d3b559bc196e1e579acc92b\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">actively hiring</a> across product and engineering teams, including product managers, senior developers, engineers, and technical leaders.
