However, Amazon rejected this report, referring to it as a 'miscalculation'.Last week, Amazon France announced a commitment to replace plastic pouches used for small items with paper bags or envelopes by the end of the year.Recently, Amazon also introduced a kerbside-recyclable insulation packaging solution made from recycled paper to make its grocery deliveries more sustainable.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
