Curious customers can check out some of the items in person at their pop-up caf\u00e9, opening in the King West neighbourhood on <span>December 7, 2021</span> . In early 2022, GoodGood will announce the opening of a series of caf\u00e9 and wine bars coming to various <span>Toronto</span> neighbourhoods.</p>\n<p>\"We want to bring these innovative products that makers have poured their heart and soul into directly to local neighbourhoods that otherwise might never have heard of them,\" says <span>Robert Kim</span> , co-founder and CEO of GoodGood. \"Torontonians shouldn't have to resort to Amazon or scouring multiple locations across the city to get great products. <span>Canada</span> , and more locally, <span>Toronto</span> , has a huge amount of entrepreneurs making incredible items, and we can't wait to showcase them.\"</p>\n<p>For the first time in <span>Toronto</span> , locally curated coffees, specialty beverages, one-of-a-kind healthy snacks (and some not-so-healthy snacks), plus everyday favourites will be offered via instant delivery (60 minutes or less) to neighbouring customers <span>(note: same/next day delivery available throughout <span>Toronto</span> , with instant delivery range quickly expanding)</span> .

Canadian makers include City Seltzer, Honey's Ice Cream, Mid-Day Squares, Heartbeat Hot Sauce, Smart Sweets, and 100s more.</p>\n<p>\"Globally, we've seen the concept of localized quick commerce and instant delivery take off,\" says <span>Ameet Shah</span> , general partner, Golden Ventures. \"Rob and Kris are, without question, the best team to bring this concept to <span>Canada</span> .
