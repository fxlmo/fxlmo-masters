Our tester also raved about the fries it produced, which it managed to cook perfectly even when the basket was loaded with three pounds worth of frozen taters. Other foods, including chicken, came out with crackling crusts that made our tester feel as though they'd been deep fried, even though they were cooked in thin air.
