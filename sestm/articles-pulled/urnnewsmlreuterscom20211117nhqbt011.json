CCI should be asked to adjudicate and decide this matter within the next few weeks,\" the plea said.</p><p>The CAIT has prayed that between the fights of corporate giants, traders should not be made a scapegoat or suffer any financial loss.</p><p>CAIT stated that Amazon's claim of control over FRL through their investment in FCPL is illegal as no foreign company is allowed to own or control a multi-brand retail company such as Future Retail Limited. \"Had Amazon declared their intent of such control and relevant fact in their notice to CCI at the time of seeking its approval, CCI would have never allowed such illegal transaction to happen and therefore we are expecting CCI to revoke its approval,\" CAIT said in a press statement.</p><p>CAIT in its press statement further said, if such misrepresentations are allowed to continue, then every company would misrepresent the facts of transactions just to seek CCI's approval and subsequently carry out a different transaction camouflaged as a transaction approved by CCI.</p><p>It further added that the proposed transactions contemplated in the FRL's Scheme, if given effect, would ensure that the tens of thousands of investors and shareholders would get a lifeline to recover their hard-earned monies entrusted to the Future Group. Banks, including public sector banks, would avoid the prospect of yet another major Non-Performing loan being added to their book</p><p>CAIT has sought relief from the Court to issue directions calling for all documents, records, internal notes, and other information relating to the subject matter of the present petition from the Competition Commission of India.
