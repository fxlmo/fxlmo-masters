The vessel is expected to drag up to 48 air guns methodically through 6 011km\u00b2 of ocean surface, firing shock wave emissions.</p><p>It is anticipated that the seismic survey would take in the order of four to five months to complete, depending on weather and current conditions.</p><p>Vessels engaged in fishing have been requested to, so far as possible, keep out of the way of the seismic operation.</p><p>Activists say the high noise blasting of sonar canons under water for seismic testing is a direct threat to whales, dolphins, fish and marine life.</p><p>They also say it is a threat to the livelihood of communities along the Wild Coast who use the riches of the sea to put food on the table and provide an income for their homes.</p><p>More than 145 000 people have already signed a petition calling on the South African government to withdraw approval for the Shell initiative.</p><p>To sign the petition, visit: <a href=\"https://www.change.org/ShellOil-Off-Our-Coast\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.change.org/ShellOil-Off-Our-Coast</a></p><p>* Video compiled by Armand Hough</p><p><span>Cape Times</span> </p><p>Cape Times \u00a9 1999 - 2021 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.
