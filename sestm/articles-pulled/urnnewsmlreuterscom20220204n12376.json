AWS accounted for 13% of Amazon's revenue last year and 74% of its operating income. Cloud made up 7.5% of Alphabet's revenue. The Intelligent Cloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of Microsoft\u2019s overall sales.</p><p>Amazon attributed its cloud growth last year to expanding its sales team, adding data centers in new regions and clients moving faster to the cloud in the face of the pandemic. </p><p>Its cloud results were one of several factors sending Amazon's stock as much as 17% higher in extended trade on Thursday. Other cloud companies gained as Amazon's results highlighted the industry's prospects.
