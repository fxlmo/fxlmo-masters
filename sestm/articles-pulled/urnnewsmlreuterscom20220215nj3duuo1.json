If successful, the warehouse would be the first Amazon facility to unionize in the US. Employees said that Amazon \u2013 which now employs more than 1 million people in the US \u2013 is fighting hard to make sure this vote also fails, but some are feeling more confident the second time around.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Darryl Richardson, an employee at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer for two years, said workers and organizers are now more apt to resist Amazon's union-busting efforts.</p><p>\"They're still using the same scare tactics they used last time, but due to the first election, you have employees who understand and know that Amazon isn't telling them the truth,\" said Richardson. \"I feel better this time than I did the first time. Employees have been voicing their opinions and standing strong this election.\"</p><p>More than 6,100 workers are eligible to vote in the union election, which will determine if workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).

A lot of people come in and they're not there for six or seven months, they don't make it that long because of the working conditions.\"</p><p>Rerun union elections are relatively rare, with unions prevailing in a <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/amazon-worker-union-drive-faces-steep-odds-in-election-do-over\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">slim majority</a> of those elections in recent years. But Connelly claimed this time around, there's more support for the union. He said many workers switched from voting no in the first election to supporting it, because Amazon didn't fulfill the promises they made during the first election, and the union organizing campaign has expanded to handing out union T-shirts, door-knocking efforts that weren't possible earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, and partnering with other local unions and community groups.</p><p>Connelly cited issues such as better pay, better promotional opportunities, more respect from management toward workers and less hostility toward productivity rates as a few of the reasons he is supporting the union.</p><p>\"We're not asking for a lot. We're just asking for better conditions and less work hassle. We feel like we're in a hostile work environment day in and day out,\" said Connelly. \"Working for Amazon, no one should be worried about paying bills when you work for a multibillionaire, and we just want what we think is fair.\"</p><p>US businesses have fought hard against union drives in recent years. A 2019 <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/unlawful-employer-opposition-to-union-election-campaigns/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">report</a> by the Economic Policy Institute found that 41.5% of employers had violated federal labor law in union election campaigns and employers spend about $340m annually on union avoidance, issues that have driven campaigns for <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/how-pro-act-will-help-employees-advocate-improvements-work\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">federal labor law reforms</a> to expand workers' rights and steepen penalties for employers violating labor laws.</p><p>As part of the new election ruling, Amazon reached a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-national-labor-relations-board-523e6836eeb618755e44a4d9454592ef\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">settlement</a> with the NLRB, agreeing to refrain from threatening workers with discipline or calling the police on workers engaging in union activity outside the warehouse. If Amazon is found to violate the settlement, the NLRB could more easily sue the company.</p><p>Amazon is once again aggressively opposing the unionization effort at the warehouse, with regular <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-alabama-national-labor-relations-board-c98220996649c7cbb14a29468f053edc\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">anti-union meetings</a> where outside consultants and managers are encouraging workers to vote against the union. A worker at the Bessemer warehouse has already <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/case/10-CA-289418\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">filed</a> unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-bessemer-retaliation-ulp-rwdsu-025525584.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">alleging</a> the settlement was violated because he claims management warned him about speaking with co-workers about the union.</p><p>During the first union election, Amazon installed a United States Postal Service mailbox in front of the warehouse, surrounded by signs encouraging workers to vote no in the election. That mailbox was a significant factor in the first union election being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/business/amazon-bessemer-alabama-election.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">overturned</a> by the NLRB.
