We are demonstrating our commitment to work across our entire value chain to help avoid global impacts from climate change. We are also pleased to be joining many of our customers in this initiative, as well as key partners, including Microsoft, Accenture and Schneider Electric, that have already committed to this pledge,\u201d commented Peter Herweck, AVEVA CEO.</p>\n<p>Race to Zero is a global campaign designed to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, and investors for a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates jobs, and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth. It aims to mobilize a coalition of leading net zero initiatives and is the largest ever alliance committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Collectively participants now cover nearly 25% of global CO2 emissions and over 50% of GDP. AVEVA\u2019s objective is to build momentum and spur rapid action around decarbonization ahead of COP26, where governments must strengthen their contributions to the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p>Andrew Griffith MP, the UK\u2019s Net Zero Business Champion also commented, \u201cCongratulations to AVEVA on joining the UN\u2019s Race to Zero campaign. This demonstrates great leadership and goes hand in hand with the company\u2019s work to support clients like National Grid and Anglian Water in creating a positive impact on the environment. AVEVA joins 46 other FTSE100 companies in the Race to Zero, together representing over a trillion pounds in market capitalization. With just 100 days to go until we host the COP26 Summit in Glasgow \u2013 the time to act is now.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Collaborating to Nurture Sustainability Throughout its Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>AVEVA has already joined a number of corporate sustainability initiatives to date that bring together companies to work on climate challenges collectively, including BSR and the UN Global Compact. Most recently AVEVA joined The Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) a joint collaboration of large clean energy buyers, energy providers, and service providers that, together with NGO partners, are unlocking the marketplace for all nonresidential energy buyers to lead a rapid transition to a cleaner, prosperous, zero-carbon energy future.</p>\n<p>\u201cAVEVA, remains committed to lead sustainable innovation and we are taking affirmative actions to embed sustainability into our operations, our culture and our core business strategy,\u201d commented Herweck. \u201cBy being part of the Race to Zero initiative, we are leading by example and setting the direction we will take to drive sustainability throughout our own operations, and the software we develop for our customers globally. We will continue\u00a0to\u00a0formalize\u00a0our sustainability pledges across\u00a0all our focus areas as well as develop interim\u00a0goals to help us\u00a0report and communicate on our progress, and we look forward to sharing more details in the months to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s AVEVA announcements builds on a recent climate mitigation commitment made by AVEVA as part of its long-term sustainability agenda. In June 2021, the company announced its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its operations (Scopes 1 &amp; 2) by 2030, as well as its plans to submit ambitious mitigation targets for external validation by the\u00a0Science Based Targets\u00a0initiative (SBTi) before the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<div><b><span>Send us your press releases to</span>\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com</a></b></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnote-disclaimer\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
