This sentiment was echoed across the S&amp;P 500,\n  with consumer discretionary and tech sectors ripping higher. The gains were\n  led by some of the most oversold stocks of recent weeks, with Tesla, Netflix,\n  AMD and NVIDIA all sharply higher.\n* The risk-on appetite was reflected in the underperformance for value stocks\n  and defensive sectors, leading healthcare and consumer staples to\n  underperform - sitting at the bottom of the pile in the S&amp;P 500.\n* The progression of earnings season remains a focus, with Meta (Facebook),\n  Alphabet (Google) and Amazon all due in the coming days.
