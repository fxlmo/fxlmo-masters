The vessels are called ?Ships of Hope? by these populations and carry medical, dental, hospital and health care. In addition, the vessels promote health promotion campaigns, research into tropical diseases and search and rescue missions. The ships visit the riverside populations and spend between 2 and 3 days in each location providing assistance.</p><p>?There are, in all, four hospital care ships in the Amazon and there these ships are called Ships of Hope because they have this characteristic of bringing health to the population that lives in more distant locations, where many health functions are not enough?, explained the Captain of Sea and War of the Navy, Jose Paulo Brandao.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>In 2023, the service should be expanded with the arrival of another ship. In partnership with the Navy, the Federal Government allocated R$ 14 million for the construction of another vessel, the Anna Nery Social and Hospital Assistance ship, and the acquisition of medical equipment to assist riverside dwellers. The ship will serve the people of Par? and Amap? from April 2023.</p><p>?Today, in Para, we have a ship called Navio Auxiliar Par?, which has in its structure the capacity to bring health to the riverside population of Par? and Amap?, but, from 2023, with the conclusion of the construction of the Ana Nery, the Navy of the state of Par? and Amap? will have this capacity increased by having a ship that will be exclusively dedicated to the riverside population?, explained Jos? Paulo Brand?o.</p><p>?In the locations where he works, which will be all the riverside communities of Par? and Amap?, he stays in each location for two to three days, providing care during the day for eight hours?, he added.</p><p>Structure of the new ship</p><p>The new Hospital Assistance Ship will have triage, dressing, recovery, medication, sample collection, x-ray, image scanning, vaccination, ultrasound, mammography and sterilization rooms. It will also have medical, ophthalmological and dental offices, wards, pharmacy, in addition to an analysis laboratory and operating room for simpler cases. The vessel was named Anna Nery, in honor of a nurse who volunteered to participate in the Paraguayan War, providing support in hospitals that treated wounded combatants.</p><p>Service</p><p>An example of health care actions for riverside dwellers was the one that took place last October, when women from Ilha do Maraj? (PA) received special attention from the team of the Soares de Meirelles Hospital Assistance Ship. As part of the Pink October campaign, for the prevention and treatment of breast and cervical cancer, laboratory, preventive and mammogram tests were performed, in addition to the placement of an Intrauterine Device (IUD).</p><p>The vessel provided service in the cities of Breves, Melga?o, Portel and Ant?nio Lemos between October 18th and 28th. During the period he was on Maraj? Island, more than a thousand medical appointments, 166 dental appointments, 158 surgeries, 40 colposcopy, 272 preventive and 8 biopsies were carried out, in addition to the distribution of more than 41 thousand medications.</p><p>The citizenship actions of the vessels take place in the so-called Hospital Assistance Operations for the Riverside Population.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.</p></div>"}
