Now, in this critical year, and what we all know is the decisive decade, we must all stand together to protect our world. Today, I'm pleased to announce a two billion dollar pledge allocated directly to restoring nature and transforming food systems. We can not rely only on governments, NGOs, and philanthropies to solve the climate crisis. The private sector must also play its part to reduce carbon emissions.<br/></span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
