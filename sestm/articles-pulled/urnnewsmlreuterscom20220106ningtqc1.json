This is a major relief to Kishore Biyani and his retail company Future Group. However legal experts said that the order has created a conflict of laws situation, defeats the sole crux of the contractual arrangement and may dissuade foreign companies from entering the Indian market.</p><p>A Division Bench also stayed the order of the single-judge which had refused to intervene in the matter and dismissed the pleas filed by the two subsidiaries of the Future Group on Tuesday, January 04, 2022. The single judge of the High Court had denied interfering with the ongoing arbitration proceedings before Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>The Division Bench said that looking at the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), there was a prima facie case in favour of the Future Group and an irreparable loss would be caused to them if the proceedings are not stayed, according to the law platform Bar &amp; Bench. The Court has also issued notice to Amazon and said that the stay on arbitration proceedings as well as the single judge's order will remain in force till the next date of hearing, which is scheduled on February 1.</p><p>\u0093The order has created a conflict of laws situation, the Singapore arbitration tribunal is not under the jurisdiction of Delhi HC hence it is a confusing situation,\u0094 said Salman Waris, managing partner at technology law firm TechLegis Advocates &amp; Solicitors. \u0093Effectively the Singapore arbitral tribunal authority is being challenged by staying the process. The only way to effectively implement the Order of the Delhi HC will be for Future Group to get it confirmed by the Singapore High Court.\u0094</p><p>Ankita Singh, Partner, at law firm A&amp;P Partners, said the stay order of the division bench of the Hon\u0092ble Delhi high court was passed in view of the recent order by CCI against Amazon. \u0093The court has analysed the facts and circumstances in the matter and passed the stay order to avoid an irreparable loss to Future Group,\u0094 said Singh. \u0093Although the stay is operational till the next date of hearing, that is February 1. In my view, this defeats the sole crux of the contractual arrangement between the parties and agreement on a resolution method under the agreement in case of any arising of any dispute. From a macro view, this will dissuade foreign companies from entering the Indian market,\u0094 said Singh.</p><p>A P Singh, Partner at law firm MV Kini, said the stay of Arbitration proceedings at Singapore by a Division Bench of Delhi High court is definitely a drastic order and is in favour of Future group. He said the order takes into cognizance of the fact that CCI vide order dated December 17, 2021 has held its approval to main Agreement which also contains the arbitration clause between the parties in abeyance on prima facie view of suppression of facts by Amazon group. \u0093The Hon'ble Division bench has interfered on the premise of the likelihood of the main agreement itself being vitiated by misrepresentation,\u0094 said AP Singh. \u0093If such a view is ultimately proved and accepted this would break the entire deal as well as arbitration. Thus the interim order is definitely a shot in the arm for Future Group. However, there\u0092s a likelihood of renewal of perennial criticism of Indian courts interfering in the Arbitration proceedings.\u0094</p><p>Nitish Sharma, counsel at law firm AnantLaw, said the order passed by the Division Bench appears to be far fetched on various facets of law, especially when no intra-court appeal lies against an order passed under Section 227 of the Constitution of India. \u0093The decision of the single bench to not interfere in the arbitration proceedings appeared to be in the right direction considering the delay and inconvenience it would have caused to the stakeholders,\u0094 said Sharma. \u0093It would be interesting to see how the Hon\u0092ble Supreme Court of India deals with the present issue which has been on the boil since the past one year. The next date of hearing before the High Court is 1 February 2022.\u0094</p><p>Future Group declined to comment on the development, while a query sent to Amazon remained unanswered till the time of going to press. However, a source familiar with the case said that Amazon is likely going to challenge the Delhi High Court\u0092s decision on Wednesday.</p><p>An arbitration tribunal in Singapore has been hearing Amazon's case against Future Group related to the deal between the two companies. This issue goes back to August 2019, when Amazon acquired 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons, the promoter entity of FRL (Future Retail), for around Rs 1,500 crore. One year later, in August 2020, Future Group struck a $3.4-billion asset-sale deal with Reliance Industries (RIL).</p><p>In October 2020, Amazon had sent a legal notice to Future for striking a deal with RIL. It alleged that Future\u0092s $3.4-billion asset sale deal with RIL breached an agreement with Amazon. It cited its non-compete agreement with the Kishore Biyani-led chain. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules. The same month, Amazon got a favourable ruling for its plea in SIAC against the deal. In November 2020, Future moved the Delhi High Court (HC) against Amazon, alleging interference by the US firm in the deal with RIL. Since then, Amazon has been fighting a legal battle with FRL to stop Future\u0092s $3.4-billion deal with RIL.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
