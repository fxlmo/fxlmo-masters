To get it going, you need to give it a good shake, gently pump the nib a few times, then apply to your grout as you would a felt tip pen to paper. The key is not to use too much pressure, or you risk fraying the tip, making pulling neat, clean lines much more challenging \u2013 I found once the liquid was flowing, a lighter hand gave much better results, especially when you draw in one direction (now is not the time to scribble).  I chose the 5mm nib to fit between our fairly standard 12in x 12in tiles, and white because I thought it would look the freshest, but there are various options available on Amazon, including cream and light and dark grey offerings for a similar price. Despite my best efforts, the odd splodge did still end up on the floor itself \u2013 the first time it happened, I panicked, fearful that it would somehow suddenly be welded to the surface permanently, white spirit be damned. However, if you work quickly enough, I noticed that you can run a folded piece of tissue or kitchen roll along the edges and tidy it up without any repercussions. Once I realised this, it actually became my preferred technique \u2013 better to be a bit slapdash and make sure everything's fully covered than risk patchiness from being too cautious, and ultimately the lines I cleaned up manually ended up looking the sharpest. Although the pen goes on fairly opaque \u2013 you can see an obvious difference from the first pass \u2013 I needed two coats to get a crisp, solid colour that I was happy with. In the spirit of full disclosure, this meant I needed two 25g pens to fully cover approximately 260in x 140in worth of flooring. Still, with change from a \u00a310 note I can't help but feel that it was still truly excellent value. There's also a three-pack available for \u00a39.99 ( <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB08S7NNYT4%2F%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C1993308%7CB08S7NNYT4\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Amazon.co.uk</a> ), which represents a decent saving if you know you're working with a bigger space.  You need to leave your work to dry for at least an hour if you want to do a second coat, which meant I spent a grand total of two evenings on this project. Since then, I've walked over the tiles hundreds of times, spilled things on them several times more, and generally made no changes to my pretty messy everyday routine, and they still look as bright and white they did at first swipe. The verdict: Rainbow Chalk Markers grout penIf you've got a kitchen or bathroom that's feeling a bit lacklustre, but that you can't afford to rip up and start from scratch, I highly recommend giving the <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FGrout-Pen-White-Revives-Restores%2Fdp%2FB006LMFJS4%2F%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C1993308%7CB006LMFJS4\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Rainbow Chalk Markers grout pen</a> a try.
