It now needs to commit to doing so worldwide.\"The advocacy group has urged Amazon to commit to cutting down its use of plastic packaging across the world, as it has already done in Germany and India.In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"Amazon shares Oceana's ambition to protect the world's oceans and respects their work but, for a second year, their calculations are seriously flawed.\"They have overestimated our plastics usage by more than 300% and use outdated assumptions about the sources of plastic waste entering our oceans.\"The latest peer-reviewed scientific research finds that the majority of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean comes primarily from takeaway food and drink and fishing activities.\"Last month, Amazon pledged to reduce its use of plastic packaging in Germany by the end of the year.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
