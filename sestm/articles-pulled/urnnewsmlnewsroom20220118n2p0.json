Among the criteria to define a\n  'covered platform' are: 50 million monthly active users, a market\n  capitalisation greater that USD$550 billion, and being a 'critical trading\n  partner for the sale or provision of any product or service offered on or\n  directly related to the online platform.'\n* This definition only implicates a handful of tech giants: Microsoft, Google,\n  Twitter, Apple, Spotify and Amazon, all of whom have disclosed they are\n  lobbying against the bill.\n* The goal of the bill is to stop big tech companies using their dominant\n  platforms to preference their own products and services over other companies\n  competing on their platforms.\n* There appears to be some level of bipartisan support for the bill and\n  reproaching big tech could be a potential vote-winner in an election year.</pre>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Thomson Reuters Limited.</p></div>"}
