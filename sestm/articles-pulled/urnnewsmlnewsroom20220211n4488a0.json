Operating through its two trusted brands - musicMagpie in the UK and Decluttr in the US, the Group's core business model is simple: to provide consumers with a smart, trusted and sustainable way to buy, rent and sell refurbished consumer technology and physical media products.</p>\n<p>It has a strong environmental and social focus, as demonstrated by its trademarked 'smart for you, smart for the planet' ethos. Over 400,000 consumer technology products were resold to consumers in the year ended 30 November 2021 by the Group. In addition, the Directors estimate that the Group re-sells approximately 2,500 tonnes of books and disc media each year that could have ended up as waste. As a result, the Company has received the London Stock Exchange's Green Economy Mark, which recognises companies that derive 50 per cent. or more of their total annual revenue from products and services that contribute to the global 'Green Economy'.</p>\n<p>When selling to musicMagpie, the customer is offered a fixed valuation via the website, provided with free logistics to ship the products and (subject to it being 'as described') receives payment for their product on the day of arrival at the Group's warehouse.</p>\n<p>Customers purchasing from musicMagpie receive branded refurbished product for a fraction of the price of buying new. All consumer technology products sold by the Group are sold with a free 12-month warranty.</p>\n<p>The Group has the highest number of seller reviews on both Amazon and eBay and has consistently achieved extremely positive feedback scores. The Group also has a 4.6* rating on UK Trustpilot with over 200,000 reviews.</p>\n<p>For further information please visit: <a href=\"http://www.musicmagpieplc.com/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.musicmagpieplc.com/</a>\n</p>\n<p>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
