We have partnerships with Ocado, Amazon. We have Gorillas for quick commerce. We are now well covered on e-commerce,\" </p><p>Under the deal, Casino will give Gorillas access to its national brands products, but also to Monoprix\u2019s private label products, which will be available through Gorillas\u2019 app and delivered within minutes to customers in Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, Lyon and Nice, the group said.</p><p>Gorillas will also undertake packing and fast delivery of orders purchased on Monoprix and Franprix online platforms from its French micro-fulfilment stores.</p><p>Casino, which has been selling assets to reduce its debt burden, confirmed it was pressing ahead with a disposal plan aimed at raising 4.5 billion euros ($5.2 billion), with 3.1 billion of deals signed or secured to date.</p><p>Sales at the group, which controls Brazil's Grupo Pao de Acucar <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=PCAR3.SA\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"PCAR3.SA\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">PCAR3.SA</a>, totalled 7.7 billion euros in the third quarter.</p><p>On a same-store basis and excluding fuel and calendar effects, group sales rose 1%. That compares to a 4.1% decline in the second quarter when its city stores in France suffered from a lack of tourists and coronavirus curfew measures.</p><p>In France alone, sales were down 4.3% in the quarter after falling 8.4% in the second quarter, still affected by a drop in traffic during summer in the Paris region and the implementation of a health pass. French hypermarkets sales were down 9.5% in the quarter after falling 11.4% in the second quarter.</p><p>Food e-commerce, however, remained very strong, with a 26% rise in same store net sales.</p><p>     ($1 = 0.8663 euros)</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon<br/>Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten and Mark Potter)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:dominique.vidalon@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">dominique.vidalon@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; +33149495432; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://dominique.vidalon.reuters.com@reuters.net\">dominique.vidalon.reuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
