The company raised about $9 billion in FY20 and FY21 via equity issuance, selling a stake in subsidiary Airtel Africa Plc and the sale-and-leaseback of towers in Africa. The comoany management aspires to achieve a debt/EBITDA ratio of around 2.0x in the long term, Fitch said. Bharati carries a rating of \u0093BBB-/Negative\u0094.</p><p>Fitch has forecast that Bharti's capex will increase to about $5 billion in FY22 (FY21: $4.6 billion), of which $1.5 billion is likely to be paid upfront to acquire 5G spectrum assets.</p><p>The company will seek to strengthen its fibre infrastructure - connecting towers with fibre and backhaul infrastructure to prepare its network to launch 5G services in 2022-2023. The capex on 5G infrastructure during 2022-2023 will replace 4G investments, as 4G coverage is largely complete, the rating agency added.</p><p>Bharti's revenue and EBITDA grew by 15 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, year-on-year in Q1FY22. The industry's monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to rise by 15-20 per cent to Rs 175 ($2.4) in the next 12 months (Q1FY22: Rs 146). This rise in ARPU is driven by headline tariff increases and increasing migration of 2G users to higher-priced 4G plans.</p><p>Bharti increased the minimum amount that a prepaid user must pay to keep a number active to Rs 79 ($1) from Rs 49. Management believes that industry-blended ARPU needs to increase to around Rs 200 in the next 12 months and to Rs 300 in the medium term.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
