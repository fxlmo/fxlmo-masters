The JV had enabled over 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online. It also enabled 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities, providing these small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and merchants access to millions of customers across the country.</p><p>The relationship between Murthy and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos dates to 2014, when Prione, a 49:51 JV, was formed. In 2019, the JV was restructured after the government issued Press Note 2 stipulating that foreign e-commerce marketplaces cannot sell the products of their group companies on their platforms.</p><p>Following this, Catamaran Ventures increased its stake in Prione to 76 per cent, reducing Amazon Asia\u0092s stake to 24 per cent. Prione\u0092s mission was to enable small and medium businesses (SMBs) to grow in e-commerce, which was at a nascent stage in India. Last year, Prione enabled 52,000 SMBs and its goal this year was to assist 100,000 businesses. With operations in Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai, Prione had over 700 employees and has a reach in at least 150 Indian cities.</p><p>A major chunk of Prione\u0092s revenues came from its ownership of Cloudtail, one of the biggest and most profitable retailers on Amazon\u0092s platform.</p><p>In August this year, concerted pressure from the government, powerful traders\u0092 lobbies and regulatory scrutiny prompted Amazon and Catamaran Ventures to announce that it would discontinue the JV when it ends on May 19, 2022. With this, Cloudtail technically ceases to be an Amazon group company, making it compliant with the foreign direct investment (FDI) e-commerce rules on paper.</p><p>With the country\u0092s online market projected to soar to $1 trillion, this was a major setback for the American e-commerce giant. Analysts had said that the future of Cloudtail was uncertain. They had said Amazon may reach out to large brands to take over the business from Cloudtail and it may even be sold to other players.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
