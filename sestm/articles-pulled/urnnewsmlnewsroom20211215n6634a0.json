In the case of SLPET's valuation at 30 November 2021, excluding new investments, 96.8% by value of the portfolio valuations were dated 30 September 2021. The value of the portfolio is therefore calculated as the 30 September 2021 valuation, adjusted for subsequent cashflows over the period to 30 November 2021. This is an update from the estimated NAV at 31 October 2021, which was based on valuations dated 30 June 2021, adjusted for subsequent cashflows over the period to 31 October 2021.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Estimated NAV</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At 30 November 2021, SLPET's estimated NAV was 665.3 pence per share (estimated net assets \u00a31,022.9 million), representing a 8.5% per share increase from the estimated NAV at 31 October 2021 of 613.0 pence per share (estimated net assets \u00a3942.5 million). The 52.3 pence increase in NAV per share reflected gains arising primarily from the quarterly revaluation of the portfolio as at 30 September 2021, which resulted in a uplift of 8.0% in the value of the portfolio on a constant currency basis. In addition, the movement in NAV is due to a 0.8% appreciation in the euro versus sterling during November.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Drawdowns and distributions</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>SLPET paid \u00a326.3 million of drawdowns and received \u00a314.0 million of distributions during the month of November.</span>\n<span>The distributions received generated realised gains and income of \u00a37.9 million.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Investment activity</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A new primary commitment of $20.0 million was made to Great Hill Partners VIII in November.

The estimate of fair value is normally the latest valuation placed on an investment by its manager at the balance sheet date. The valuation policies used by the manager in undertaking that valuation will generally be in line with the joint publication from EVCA and BVCA, 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation guidelines'. Where formal valuations are not completed at the balance sheet date, the last available valuation from the manager is adjusted for any subsequent cashflows occurring between the valuation date and the balance sheet date. The Company's Manager may further adjust such valuations to reflect any changes in circumstances from the last manager's formal valuation date to arrive at the estimate of fair value.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Company intends to release regular estimated NAV updates around ten business days after each month end, while continuing to issue quarterly updates.
