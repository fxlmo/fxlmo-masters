Based on last year's revenue, that could total around $38.6 billion for Amazon. </p><p>Amazon is also under fire in India after thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by Reuters show it ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2R90MW\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2R90MW\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>It also faces a Washington D.C. antitrust lawsuit over its agreements with wholesalers as well as third-party sellers. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2QF1DW\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2QF1DW\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:foo.yunchee@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">foo.yunchee@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; +32 2 287 6844; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://foo.yunchee.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">foo.yunchee.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
