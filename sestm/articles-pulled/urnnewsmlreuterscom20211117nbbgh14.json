Julian Satterthwaite reports.<br/>Short Link: <a href=\"https://refini.tv/2YTElC3\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://refini.tv/2YTElC3</a><br/><br/>Video Transcript:<br/><br/>Amazon and Visa seem to have fallen out, in the UK at least. The ecommerce giant says it will stop accepting credit cards issued in the country by Visa. It says the fees charged by the firm are too high. The change will come into effect from January 19. Merchants have long disputed fees with card issuers. Back in 2019, a unit of US retailer Kroger stopped taking Visa credit cards over the issue. In the UK, Amazon customers will still be able to use Mastercard and American Express, as well as Visa debit cards. There was no immediate comment from Visa on the news.<br/></span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
