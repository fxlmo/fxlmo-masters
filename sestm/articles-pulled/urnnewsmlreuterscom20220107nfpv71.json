This represents a subtle legal twist and one whose merits may be debated as Credo gets closer to its US listing.</p>\n              <p>Credo also disclosed that it issued 4.1m warrants to a subsidiary of Amazon, described as a customer warrant, that would result in gross aggregate proceeds of US$201m if exercised. The Amazon agreement was signed on December 28.</p>\n              <p>Credo both makes and holds IP licences to networking gear. A growing amount of its business is coming from sales of owned products.</p>\n              <p>In the six months ended October 31, Credo generated revenue of US$37.2m, compared to US$25.5m in the comparable year-ago period. It posted a net loss of US$16.7m in the first six months of fiscal 2022.</p>\n              <p>Credo is careful to delineate ties to China. In the fiscal year ended April 30, it generated just 0.3% of revenue in mainland China. Mainland China is home to 14% of \"long lived assets\".</p>\n              <p>The holding company structure, with operating subsidiaries in the US, China and Hong Kong, is a novel approach to a festering problem.</p>\n              <p>(Stephen Lacey)</p>\n              <p>((stephen.lacey@refinitiv.com; 646-337-7349))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2022.
