ES1 is now down over\n  65 points and is nearing first major support at the 4559.9 100-dma.\n* As mentioned, the tech and growth sectors are the ones to watch, with rising\n  yields across the curve working against the likes of Tesla (-3.6%), Etsy\n  (-5.5%) and Amazon (-3.0%) among the poorest performers. No surprise then to\n  see the NASDAQ Comp and NASDAQ 100 lagging, while value names help limit\n  losses among the DJIA.\n* Moves come ahead of the unofficial beginning of Q1 earnings season, as\n  JPMorgan, BlackRock, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all report on Friday.</pre>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Thomson Reuters Limited.</p></div>"}
