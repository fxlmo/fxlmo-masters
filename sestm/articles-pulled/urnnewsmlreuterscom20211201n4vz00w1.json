Along with projects announced earlier this year, the new projects mean Amazon will add 5.6 GW of new renewable energy capacity in 2021, moving Amazon further down the path to power operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025-five years earlier than the original target of 2030. The 5.6 GW of electricity production capacity procured in 2021 is a 40% increase from the 4 GW procured in 2020.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          In total, Amazon has announced 274 global renewable energy projects, including 105 utility-scale wind and solar projects, and 169 solar rooftops on facilities and stores worldwide, making it the largest buyer of renewable energy in the world.\n        </p>\n                  <div>\n          \"Amazon is wasting no time demonstrating that the company is fully committed to a clean energy future.\" \n          <div><div>\n              Gregory Wetstone\n            </div><div>\n              President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy\n            </div></div></div>\n                  <p>\n          These new projects will bring Amazon's total committed renewable electricity production capacity to more than 12 GW and 33,700 gigawatt hours (GWh) when the projects become fully operational, or the electricity output equivalent to powering more than 3 million U.S. homes for a year.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          The projects will supply renewable energy for Amazon's corporate offices, fulfillment centers, and AWS data centers that support millions of customers globally.
