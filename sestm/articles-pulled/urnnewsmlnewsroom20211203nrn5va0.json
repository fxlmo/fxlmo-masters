(\"Fortium\" or the \"Company\") announced that its\nwholly-owned subsidiary, Elysian Premium Corp. (\"Elysian\"), has entered\ninto an agreement with Firebreak Associates, Inc. (\"Firebreak\"), for the\nexclusive license to use the Cannablue trademarks and service marks in the\nUnited States in connection with the branding of Elysian stores and related\nsale of products for an initial term of five years. Cannablue's flagship\nstore is a premium dispensary that is fully licensed and currently\noperational in South Lake Tahoe, California. Additional terms of the\nagreement are disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed\nwith the SEC on December 3, 2021.\n\n  \"We performed extensive research on cannabis dispensaries across multiple\nstates and identified a significant opportunity to offer customers with a\nhigh-quality environment,\" stated Richard Horgan, Chief Executive Officer\nof Fortium. \"A majority of the dispensaries we visited as part of our\ndiligence process lacked the elements we believe are essential in enabling\na top-of-class retail and customer experience. Cannablue offers a\ndifferentiated environment where the customer can view, smell, and handle\nproducts in a crisp, clean and modern upscale environment. Additionally, we\nbelieve the company's store design and business model are scalable across\nmultiple locations in multiple states, reflecting significant strategic\nvalue as we embark on our mission of establishing and expanding Elysian's\nfootprint.\"\n\n  \"At Cannablue, we focus on constant innovation to improve and elevate the\ncustomer journey,\" added Alex Gosselin, Chief Executive Officer of\nFirebreak. \"We take pride in our premium store design, streamlined delivery\nservice, and interactive shopping experience. Our top priority is to scale\nand expand, bringing our unique model to a wider set of customers.\nPartnering with Richard and the Fortium/Elysian team offers an incredible\nopportunity to achieve our mission of establishing a Cannablue location in\nevery state where cannabis is legal.\"\n\n  In September 2021, Fortium announced its entry into the cannabis industry\nwith the formation of Elysian to address luxury cannabis market demand.\n\n  About Fortium Holdings Corp.\n\n  Founded in 2011, Fortium is a diversified holding company. The company\nhas two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Elysian Premium Corp. (\"Elysian\") and\nNorr LLC (\"Norr\").
