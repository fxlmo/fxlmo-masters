continued to execute on our network and distribution expansion plans, driving continued strong growth in ARPUs across voice, data and mobile money. We have also seen further improvement in our customer growth trends for the Group with Nigeria returning to strong customer growth after a period affected by the implementation of new 'know your customer' requirements, posting 1.9 million net additions in the third quarter, taking total Group customer additions to 3.1 million.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          I am particularly pleased with developments in Nigeria, where in November we received approval in principle for both a payment service bank (mobile money) licence and a super-agent licence. We are now working closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the final operating licences and commence operations. This will enable us to expand our digital financial products and reach the millions of Nigerians that do not have access to traditional financial services.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          We continued to strengthen our balance sheet, with our leverage ratio now 1.4 times underlying EBITDA, thanks both to the continued increases in operating cash flow delivery and to the $550m of cash that has now been received from minority investments into our mobile money business.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          We will continue to invest in expanding and evolving our platform to further deepen both financial and digital inclusion across Africa. I continue to see huge growth potential across voice, data and mobile money and our strategy is delivering against this opportunity. Our sustained investments in both network and distribution expansion will help to ensure that both the communities and economies across our footprint will continue to benefit from increased and affordable connectivity and financial inclusion. We are committed to continue to improve the delivery of our services to our customers, with sustainability at the heart of our continued purpose to transform lives across Africa.\"\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          1\n        </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <p>\n          Airtel Africa plc ('Airtel Africa' or 'Group') results for nine-month period ended 31 December 2021 are unaudited and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the same period.

Reported revenue grew by 21.7%.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Underlying revenue in constant currency grew by 24.8%. Revenue in Nigeria grew by 29.0%, in East Africa by 24.4% and in Francophone Africa by 19.0% in constant currency. We continued our strong double-digit growth across all key services: our voice revenue grew by 16.1%, and both data revenue and mobile money revenue grew by 37.2%, and other revenue by 22.0%. As a result, mobile services revenue grew by 23.3% in constant currency (20.7% in reported currency) and mobile money services revenue grew by 37.2% (39.6% in reported currency). The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth rate for Q3'22 of 20.0% was lower than the nine-month growth rate of 24.8% primarily due to softer comparatives in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Net finance costs were lower compared with the previous period driven by lower forex losses. The increase in tax charges of $129m was due to higher operating profit and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries, with the prior period also benefitting from $14m deferred tax credit recognition.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Basic EPS improved to 11.7 cents and EPS before exceptional items improved to 11.5 cents, with higher profits more than offsetting the associated increased tax.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Net debt was $3,050m, a reduction of $468m mainly due to increased cash generation and proceeds from Airtel Money investments. Leverage improved to 1.4x from 2.1x in the previous period, largely driven by increased cash generation, expansion in underlying EBITDA and $550m of receipts from mobile money minority investors. Our balance sheet has also been further de-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          GAAP measures\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Revenue\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Reported revenue grew by 21.7% to $3,492m. The prior period benefitted from a one-time exceptional revenue of $20m relating to a settlement in Niger. Excluding this, revenue grew by 22.5% in reported currency and by 24.8% in constant currency. The difference relates to currency devaluations, mainly in the Nigerian naira (6.3%) and the Malawian kwacha (8.2%), in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Ugandan shilling (4.3%) and the Central African franc (2.0%). Revenue growth for the 9 months period benefitted from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region. However, even after adjusting for this, Group revenue growth rates were ahead of FY'21.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Operating profit\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Operating profit was $1,146m, growing by 43.1% in reported currency as a result of strong revenue growth and improvements in operating efficiency across all our regional segments.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Net finance costs\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Net finance costs decreased by $27m, as a result of lower foreign exchange losses and a one-time $12m gain in other finance charges as a result of the reversal of an interest provision in one of our operating entities.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          The Group effective interest rate increased from 4.8% to 5.6% largely driven by the repayment of the Eurobond in May 2021, which carried a lower than average coupon and higher local currency debt at the OpCo level.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Taxation\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Total tax charges increased by $129m, largely due to higher operating profit and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. The prior period also benefited from the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $14m in Tanzania.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Profit after tax\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Profit after tax almost doubled to $514m, an increase of 97.3%. The increase was mainly led by higher operating profits along with lower net finance costs, which more than offset the increase in tax charges due to increased profits.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Basic EPS\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Basic EPS more than doubled to 11.7 cents, an improvement of 6.2 cents, up from 5.5 cents in the prior period. The increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset the increased tax charges.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          4\n        </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <p>\n          Net cash generated from operating activities\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Net cash generated from operating activities increased by $282m, an increase of 23.1% to $1,499m (from $1,217m in the previous period), mainly driven by higher profit before tax of $382m partially offset by higher tax payments on the increased profits.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Alternative performance measures<span>1</span></p>\n                  <p>\n          Underlying revenue\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Underlying revenue in constant currency grew by 24.8% driven by customer base growth of 5.8% to 125.8 million and strong ARPU growth of 17.1%. Customer base growth was affected by the new NIN/SIM registration regulations in Nigeria; excluding Nigeria the customer base grew by 12.0%. In Nigeria, while year on year our customer base has declined by 2 million, our customer base returned to growth in the third quarter, adding 1.9 million customers and contributing towards total Group net customer additions of 3.1 million. ARPU growth of 17.1% was driven largely by growth in the contribution from data ARPU of 8.5%, followed by voice contribution growth of 4.8%, mobile money contribution growth of 3.0%, and with the balance coming from growth in other revenue.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          All our regional segments and key services posted strong revenue growth; Nigeria grew by 29.0%, East Africa by 24.4% and underlying revenue in Francophone Africa grew by 19.0%. Voice revenue grew by 16.1%, and both data and mobile money grew by 37.2% in constant currency.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Underlying EBITDA\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Underlying EBITDA increased by 31.3% to $1,703m in reported currency while in constant currency growth was 34.1%. The growth in underlying EBITDA was led by revenue growth and supported by improved operating efficiencies. The underlying EBITDA margin was 48.8%, an improvement of 326 basis points in reported currency and 338 basis points in constant currency.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          During the period, foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $47m on revenue and $23m on underlying EBITDA, as a result of devaluation of the Nigerian naira and the Malawian kwacha, in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Ugandan shilling, the Zambian kwacha and the Central African franc.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          With respect to currency sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a 1% currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of $41m on revenues, $25m on underlying EBITDA and $22m on finance costs. Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which each 1% of devaluation would have a negative impact of $17m on revenues, $10m on underlying EBITDA and $7m on finance costs.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Tax\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          The effective tax rate was 39.6% compared to 45.5% in the prior period, largely a result of profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 33%, largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and the withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Exceptional items\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          An exceptional gain of $9m was recorded in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2021 on the sale of telecommunication tower assets in the Group's subsidiaries in Rwanda and Madagascar. The prior period exceptional gain of $28m includes one-time exceptional revenue of $20m relating to a settlement in Niger and a deferred tax credit recognition in Tanzania amounting to $14m, partially offset by one-off costs of $6m in Francophone Africa.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          EPS before exceptional items\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          EPS before exceptional items more than doubled to 11.5 cents, an improvement of 6.5 cents, up from 5.0 cents in the prior period. The increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset the increased tax charges.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Operating free cash flow\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Operating free cash flow increased by 42.2% to $1,271m due to higher underlying EBITDA more than offsetting increased capital expenditure. Capital expenditure in the prior period was slightly lower due to logistical challenges as a result of the pandemic.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Leverage\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Leverage (net debt to underlying EBITDA) improved to 1.4x at 31 December 2021, from 2.1x at 31 December 2020, largely driven by increased cash generation, expansion in underlying EBITDA and receipts of $550m from mobile money minority investments. Our balance sheet continued to be de-risked through a reduction of net debt (now $3.0bn, from $3.5bn in the prior period) and increased localisation of our debt into the OpCos, such that our gross OpCo debt of $2,636m is now higher than our HoldCo debt of $1,505m.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>1</span> Alternative performance measures (APM) are described on page 17.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          5\n        </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"noodls_PartTextMsg\">\n                <p>\n        This is an excerpt of the original content.
