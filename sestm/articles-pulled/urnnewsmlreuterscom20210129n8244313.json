And our entire current focus is on these countries in order to grow, we are not looking at bidding for Ethiopia at this stage,\" he said in an interview. </p><p>On Friday, the company, a unit of India's Bharti Airtel Ltd., said that its nine-month reported revenue increased by 13.8% to $2.87 billion, with third quarter revenue up by 19.5%. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL8N2K41U0\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL8N2K41U0\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>The company reported a slight decline in profit before tax to $482 million in the period to Dec. 31, 2020 from $501 million in the period to Dec. 31, 2019. It attributed the drop to a combination of higher finance costs and benefits from non-operating exceptional items in the prior period. </p><p>Excluding the benefit of exceptional items and the one-off derivative gain in the prior period, profit before tax rose by 20.4%, it said.</p><p>The company said that its Nigerian subsidiary has collected national identity numbers from nearly half of its customers as part of a process to adhere to regulator demands to add valid National Identification Numbers to every SIM card registered in the country. It was working to verify the data, Mandava said. </p><p>\"This could require a little bit more time and we will not be able to complete the full exercise, in which case, after all efforts if we don't manage by Feb. 9 then we will, I am sure discuss with the government and request for some extension,\" he told Reuters. </p><p><br/></p><p>GOING SOLO</p><p>After Airtel Kenya's merger with Telkom fell through, the company has \"invested solo\" on expanding its rural network as a way to compete with market leader Safaricom. </p><p>\"We are consistently gaining market share over the last few years, and we are growing quite handsomely in Kenya on our own,\" Mandava said.</p><p>The company still sees voice as crucial to growth in the future<span class=\"tr-strong\">, </span>as huge swathes of the continent are still under-using their phones, as costs still remain high. </p><p>\"We all need to work towards reducing this interconnect costs in some countries,\" Mandava said.</p><p>\"The need for telecommunication is far higher, it's a latent, inherent demand that exists, that we as operators are not fulfilling enough. And if you can do a good job of it, you can grow faster.\" </p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Omar Mohammed, Editing by William Maclean)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:omar.mohammed@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">omar.mohammed@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; +254 20 499 1232; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://omar.mohammed.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">omar.mohammed.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
