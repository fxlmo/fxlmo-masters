This new e-commerce hub will provide needed revenue to the Port Authority while also bringing new jobs to our state.\"This airport's cargo business is being expanded as part of the ongoing airport-wide redevelopment project.A new Terminal A is currently being completed on the south end of the airport.Meanwhile, the Port Authority is also working towards the replacement of the outdated AirTrain Newark.In May 2021, a request for proposal for a design-builder for the AirTrain was released to four pre-selected design and construction teams.Last month, the US Department of Homeland Security agency Transportation Security Administration allowed three airports to enter into security agreements with Amazon Air.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
