The SC will hear the case next on March 9.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-lead\"><p>Amazon approached the SC after the Delhi High Court (HC) ordered a stay on the Amazon-Future arbitration going on before a three-member arbitral tribunal.</p><p>\u0093The present SLP (special leave petition) is in one way connected to the outcome of the order challenged before the NCLAT. We direct parties to request the NCLAT to decide the case,\u0094 the SC Bench \u0096 comprising Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justice A S Bopanna, and Justice Hima Kohli \u0096 said in its order.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>The NCLAT on February 25 will hear Amazon\u0092s plea seeking an interim stay on the order passed by the CCI, which suspended the over two-year-old approval of its deal with Future Coupons (FCPL).</p><p>On February 9, the SC had issued notices to Future Group to respond to Amazon\u0092s SLP, which challenged Delhi HC\u0092s divisional Bench order last month staying the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) proceedings in the case.</p><p>Amazon approached the SIAC in October 2020 after Future Group\u0092s deal with Reliance Industries citing its non-compete agreement with the Kishore Biyani-led chain. Amazon's 2019 deal with Future Group (stake purchase in Future Coupons) specified any disputes would be arbitrated under the SIAC rules. The same month, Amazon got a favourable ruling for its plea in the SIAC against the Future-Reliance deal.</p><p>In November 2020, Future Group then challenged the SIAC\u0092s interim order at the Delhi High Court and in February 2021, a single-judge Bench order upheld the SIAC\u0092s interim order.</p><p>In January, a single-judge Bench of HC passed an order dismissing Future Group\u0092s plea to stop arbitration proceedings initiated by Amazon in Singapore. But a divisional bench of the court ordered a stay on the Amazon-Future arbitration going on before a three-member arbitral tribunal.</p><p>In February, the Supreme Court set aside verdicts of a single judge Bench of the Delhi HC which ordered strong steps against Future Group and also the order which refused to stay the Singapore tribunal\u0092s refusal to vacate the emergency award. The Supreme Court sent the matter to HC.</p><p>HC has listed the hearing of four cases in the legal battle between Future Group and e-commerce major Amazon on February 24 (Thursday). The court will hear Future Retail\u0092s plea, along with four other cases.</p><p>The four are the SIAC\u0092s emergency award, which stalled Future Group\u0092s deal with Reliance Retail, and the SIAC tribunal order, which upheld the emergency award.</p><p>There is also Amazon\u0092s case of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) issuing summons to it on violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act while investing in Future Coupons in 2019. Also Amazon had challenged the High Court\u0092s observations in its order in December 2020.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
