I\u2019m excited to be on people\u2019s Christmas playlists because it\u2019s such a magical time of the year and getting to be part of the soundtrack during such an intimate family and friend holiday season is a real honor. It\u2019s truly special and really sacred.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cThis is one of our favorite times of the year, where we\u2019re able to bring our customers around the world a collection of brand-new music and programming to celebrate the holiday season,\u201d said Ryan Redington, VP of music industry, Amazon Music. \u201cIt\u2019s always thrilling to see a spike in the charts for Christmas classics, and our Amazon Original songs for the holidays\u2014from incredible artists like Camila Cabello, Summer Walker, and George Ezra\u2014introduce a contemporary take on the familiar favorites that our customers love to stream. In fact, in the last three years, the top 25 most popular holiday Amazon Original songs, from artists such as Katy Perry, John Legend, and Justin Bieber, have surpassed 750 million streams globally.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAmazon Music is celebrating the holidays across the globe, with new music arriving from international talent to light up the season. From the UK, singer/songwriter George Ezra will debut \u201cCome on Home for Christmas,\u201d his beautifully reworked take on Charles Brown\u2019s \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas.\u201d British Amazon Music Breakthrough artist Olivia Dean, Chinese pianist Lang Lang, and German pop-singer and songwriter Sarah Connor have each recorded their own reimagined versions of Nat King Cole\u2019s timeless classic, \u201cThe Christmas Song.\u201d In addition, Latin pop-rock trio Reik will debut their rendition of \u201cLast Christmas,\u201d and Marcos Witt will premiere a Spanglish version of \u201cNoche de Paz (Silent Night) / Santa la Noche (O Holy Night)\u201d with his daughter, Elena Witt-Guerra. From Mexico, singers Mar\u00eda Le\u00f3n, Paty Cant\u00fa, and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9<b> </b>team up for a rendition of Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d out on November 19, and French-Canadian singer-songwriter C\u0153ur de pirate premieres a melodic new original, \u201cParfait No\u00ebl.\u201d Spanish pop band La Oreja de Van Gogh will also delight customers with their version of \u201cBlanca Navidad.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cWhen I first heard I was going to do an Amazon Original, I immediately thought of the Marvin Gaye version of \u2018Purple Snowflakes,\u2019\u201d said Leon Bridges. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite Christmas songs and I love the classic stuff\u2026 but this one has a little bit more soul to it. There aren\u2019t too many renditions of this song and I wanted to kind of put my own spin on it as far as figuring out the arrangement and give it the Fort Worth, Texas approach.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cWriting original Christmas songs is difficult, because there\u2019s already so many good songs that exist and ... you feel like everything\u2019s already been said,\u201d shared Dan + Shay. \u201cOne day we sat down to write our song and it sort of poured out of us\u2014it was just the soundtrack for folks going out, families, friends going to a Christmas tree farm, or going to a store down the street and picking out a Christmas tree. We\u2019re so excited about it and hopefully it brings a little joy this holiday season.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cAbove all, it is important to give thanks! Music has given me everything, and I am grateful and humbled to use it to give back to my fans,\u201d said Sech. \"\u2018Carta Navide\u00f1a\u2019 is an original song inspired by the holiday spirit felt around the world. You can recognize the sounds often heard in the classics, but with my unique style and emotions. The lyrics express my fondest holiday memories and traditions. I hope it becomes a popular classic, too, resonating with fans and reminding them to create many happy memories and give thanks always.\u201d\n</p><p>\nIn addition to new holiday songs, Amazon Music listeners can explore hundreds of festive playlists and stations across artists and decades, including \u201cREDISCOVER: Mariah Carey Christmas,\u201d \u201cHoliday Favorites,\u201d \u201cChristmas Past,\u201d and \u201cChristmas Present,\u201d and a host of new programmed destinations. \u201cFluent Holidays\u201d is a new playlist celebrating fans who move fluidly between cultures, featuring English, Spanish and bilingual holiday tunes from artists including Reik, Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra, Camila Cabello, Katy Perry, and Sech.
