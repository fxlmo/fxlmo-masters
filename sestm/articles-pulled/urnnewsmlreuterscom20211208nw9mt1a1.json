It also aims to lower the barriers these developers can face when bidding for affordable housing developments. The goal of the program is to increase the number of professional real estate developers of color who are focused on affordable housing and inclusive community building.

We want to foster their professional growth through education and training, as well as improve their access to capital, which can be elusive to developers of color,\u201d said Catherine Buell, director of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund. \u201cIf we are going to bring about lasting, holistic, and meaningful change to how affordable housing is developed, developers of color need to be a part of the solution.\u201d\n</p><p>\nNot only are developers of color underrepresented in the real estate industry, but they also lack access to the capital and resources necessary to advance much-needed affordable housing projects to help their communities.
