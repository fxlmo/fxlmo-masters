class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Stephen Colbert</a> has jokingly criticised <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeff-bezos\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Jeff Bezos</a> after it was reported that the Amazon founder's home did not accept trick-or-treaters on <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/halloween\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Halloween</a> .</p><p>On Monday's episode of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0G_CCaTI4&amp;t=11s\"><span>The Late Show</span> </a> , Colbert addressed the claim reported by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/11/01/its-zero-hour-for-virginia-and-build-back-better-494921\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Politico</a> , which stated that a group of children <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/trick-or-treating\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">trick-or-treating</a> on Sunday night were turned away from Bezos' door in Washington, DC and told via the intercom that they \"not participating in Halloween\".</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>According to the report, the children walked away \"muttering\" that they would be attempting to cover Bezos' home in Amazon toilet paper.</p><p>On <span>The Late Show</span> , Colbert began by acknowledging that Halloween trick-or-treating is a \"simple contract,\" with children winning \"every negotiation\".</p><p>\"You've just got to say trick or treat and you get candy,\" Colbert stated, before joking: \"You say trick or treat and I don't give you candy, legally, you get to burn my house down.</p><p>\"It's in the fine print on the back of a Milky Way bar.\"</p><p>However, Colbert then acknowledged that \"not everybody was in the ooky-spooky Halloween spirit,\" including \"billionaire and <span>Squid Game</span> season ticket holder, Jeff Bezos,\" who was actually in Glasgow for the climate conference with world leaders.</p><p>\"Last night in Washington DC, a group of trick-or-treaters decided to hit up Bezos' mansion only to be told by a man on an intercom that they were 'not participating in Halloween,'\" the late night show host recounted to booing from the crowd. \"Wow.\"</p><p>Colbert then joked that Bezos' choice not to participate in Halloween doesn't make sense considering the second-richest man in the world \"spent all year\" costumed as Panic Pete the Squeeze Toy.</p><p><span>Crazy that Jeff Bezos wasn't celebrating Halloween since he spent all year in costume as Panic
