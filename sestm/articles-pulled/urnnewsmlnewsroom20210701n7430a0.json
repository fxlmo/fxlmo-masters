These are to the financial year ending 31 March 2026 (FY26) on an organic constant currency basis. They assume that the global economic outlook is stable to moderately growing and that trends toward digitalisation continue at current rates.

Recurring revenue is calculated as Subscription revenue, including Cloud revenue, plus Maintenance revenue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>AVEVA targets an adjusted EBIT margin of at least 35% in FY26.
