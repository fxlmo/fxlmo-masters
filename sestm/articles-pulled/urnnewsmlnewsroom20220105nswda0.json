Our customers\ncall Mozaics(TM) their 'guilt-free' snack indulgence - popped like popcorn\n(not fried like potato chips!), then seasoned, with a light spray of extra\nvirgin olive oil.\n\n     Mozaics(TM) showcases its new non-GMO product range that uses a\none-of-a-kind degradable packaging film that transforms into clean,\nrenewable energy through the decomposition process. Revolutionary NEO\nPlastics(TM) packaging material makes it easier for consumers to do their\npart for the planet by reducing landfill waste. Unlike other snack bags\nthat are either non-degradable or require commercial composting, the new\nMozaics(TM) packaging does not require separate recycling or disposal and\nbreaks down in any landfill once disposed of in the normal waste stream.\n\n     For more information about Mozaics(TM), please visit\nwww.mozaicschips.com.\n\n     For more information about QVC, please visit www.qvc.com.\n\n     (1) Source: <a href=\"https://corporate.qvc.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://corporate.qvc.com</a>/\n\n     About Mozaics(TM)\n\n     Mozaics(TM) Real Veggie Chips deliver tasty snacking crunch that you\ncan feel great about with plant protein per serving and dietary fiber.
