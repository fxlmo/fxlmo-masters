LG OLED C1\u00a0Series Alexa Built-in 4K Smart TV</big> </p><p>We love the LG C1 OLED TV, and it's now available for its lowest price of the year. We loved the incredible contrast and picture quality this OLED panel delivers, the sheer number of features it offers (including Dolby Vision and a 120Hz refresh rate) and its eye-catching design. If you're looking to invest in the best possible home theater experience, the LG C1 starts for as low as $1,296 in its 55-inch size, a $203 discount from its usual price of $1,499.99.

Its W1 chip can pair the headphones with any Apple or iOS device, while the built-in active noise cancelation drowns out annoying sounds like train rumblings and the hums of an air conditioner.</p><p><span>Get the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-Ear Headphones from $199.99 (Save $141.11 to $149.96)</span> </p><p><big>3.
