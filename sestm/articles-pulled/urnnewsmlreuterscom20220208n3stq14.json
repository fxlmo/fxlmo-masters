This report produced by Zachary Goelman.<br/>Short Link: <a href=\"https://refini.tv/3oxBf0k\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://refini.tv/3oxBf0k</a><br/><br/>Video Transcript:<br/><br/>Peloton is replacing its CEO and slashing thousands of jobs, changes the exercise-bike-maker announced on Tuesday as it wrestles with weakening demand for its at-home fitness equipment. Co-founder John Foley will step down as CEO and will become the executive chair. The company named Barry McCarthy, a former CFO at Spotify and Netflix Inc, to take over starting Wednesday. The executive shuffle comes after Foley fought a board-room brawl with activist investor Blackwells Capital as Peloton struggled to maintain the meteoric growth it saw in 2020 and 2021. Shares have since tumbled nearly 80%. Blackwells pushed for Foley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal and even urged the company to sell itself. Last week, Reuters reported that Peloton has drawn interest from potential buyers including e-commerce giant Amazon.com. Peloton said it would also cut roughly 2,800 jobs, affecting 20% of its corporate positions. Shares of the company rose 10% in early trading on Tuesday.</span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
