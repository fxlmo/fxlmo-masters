keeping Tavares' promise not to cut jobs or close plants following the merger. </p><p>All this despite facing a semiconductor and supply chain crunch that cost global automakers millions of vehicles in lost production last year and is not expected to ease quickly.</p><p>Marco Santino, a partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said Tavares was living up to his reputation as a practical man avoiding a \"muscular\" approach with unions and the outlines of his strategy were in place.</p><p>\"The path has been mapped out already, it needs to be consolidated,\" he said. \"I don't expect fireworks from his business plan\".    </p><p><br/></p><p>CHALLENGES </p><p>But many say more bold action is needed. </p><p>Jefferies analysts, for example, say Stellantis' 14 brands -
