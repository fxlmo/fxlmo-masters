Meatpacking plants, which were a hot spot for outbreaks early in the COVID-19 pandemic, are inspected by the USDA. The removal of masks is also dependent on local and state laws.</p><p>Tyson said it is easing mask mandates because of lower infection rates and \"extremely low rates of serious illness.\" The company last year required employees to be vaccinated.</p><p>The U.S. meat industry was hit hard by COVID-19 infections at the start of the pandemic, when thousands of infections at meat plants temporarily shut slaughterhouses.
