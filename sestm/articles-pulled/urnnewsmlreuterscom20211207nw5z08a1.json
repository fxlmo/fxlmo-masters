Addressing assets from transmission to behind-the-meter, the PowerRunner on PI System solution provides the utility industry with the granular, temporal, and locational situational awareness needed to support the growing complexities facing utilities.\n</p><p>\nThe PowerRunner solution will extend the value of data and context managed by the PI System for the growing distribution network. PowerRunner\u2019s patent-pending streaming data engine and integrated prediction layer, along with configurable data management and governance, virtually joins operational data from the PI System with other internal and external data sources across the enterprise, providing utilities with real-time visibility, analysis and predictions needed to manage the evolving bidirectional grid. The PowerRunner solution analyzes and predicts the \u201celectron traffic\u201d coordination needed to integrate the ever-increasing number of distribution system assets, thereby supporting global net-zero initiatives by enabling the adoption of renewable distributed energy resources.\n</p><p>\nAccording to <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2021-01-19%2Fspending-on-global-energy-transition-hits-record-500-billion&amp;esheet=52546350&amp;newsitemid=20211207005675&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bloomberg+Energy&amp;index=3&amp;md5=418174cf2dec1734fe15a92acecad411\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Bloomberg Energy</a>, \u201cThe world spent a record $501.3 billion in 2020 on renewable power, electric vehicles and other technologies to cut the global energy system\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.\u201d In the years to come, the electrification and decarbonization of the grid will continue to put operational constraints on a century-old system that was designed to be one-directional. The powerful combination of PI System and PowerRunner\u2019s solution gives customers a scalable data infrastructure and energy IIoT solution that ingests, joins and operates on data from millions of sensors across the grid to provide utilities with the actional information needed to safely and reliably operate the grid.\n</p><p>\n\u201cThe PI System has been the leading time-series data infrastructure for utility operations and many other industrial verticals for over 40 years,\u201d said Jason Iacobucci, PowerRunner President. \u201cWe are excited about the opportunity to work with an industry leader such as AVEVA and even more excited about our role in enabling the safe and reliable transition to the<sup> </sup>twenty-first-century distribution grid. We view this partnership as transformative both in terms of PowerRunner\u2019s trajectory and the role that PowerRunner and AVEVA will play in enabling global decarbonization.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cThe PowerRunner on PI System solution will further extend the value of PI System data for our clients,\u201d said R\u00f3n\u00e1n de Hooge, EVP of Information at AVEVA. \u201cGlobal decarbonization initiatives have spurred investments in new technologies that are changing the way in which energy is created and consumed and enabling our utility clients to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the grid.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThe PowerRunner and AVEVA Reseller Agreement provides utilities with a PI System-based solution that supports the complex and evolving requirements of the bi-directional distribution grid with a scalable data infrastructure that can be configured and re-configured by subject matter experts to meet the rapidly changing business requirements of an industry in transition.\n</p><p>\n<b>About PowerRunner</b>\n</p><p>\nPowerRunner, a leading energy IIoT analytics software provider, provides innovative, scalable and extendable solutions that extract business value from disparate Operational Technology and Information Technology data sources.
