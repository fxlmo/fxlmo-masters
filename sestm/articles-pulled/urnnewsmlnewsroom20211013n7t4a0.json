We are closely monitoring the situation, and measures are in place to minimize the spread of the virus within the institutions.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 testing is being offered to inmates and staff. Employees are required to perform rapid self-tests and attest to a negative result before entering the site to prevent possible spread at the institutions. Inmate testing numbers are available on our <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3413989-1&amp;h=890918410&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fcorrectional-service%2Fcampaigns%2Fcovid-19%2Finmate-testing.html&amp;a=website\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">website</a> . The number of inmate active cases currently reported for these institutions are based on either a rapid test or a PCR test. They may change as more testing is conducted and laboratory-confirmed results are available.</p>\n<p>This is an evolving situation and we will continue to apply and reinforce infection prevention and control measures to mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19 and adapt based on public health advice. All staff are provided with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including, for example, medical masks, respirators, and face shields. All inmates are provided medical masks and are encouraged to wear them at all times when not in their cells. Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting throughout the sites is continuing.</p>\n<p>All individuals entering the institutions are actively screened, and decisions regarding access to the sites as well as programs and services are made in consideration of public health advice. In-person visits are temporarily suspended at all institutions in the <span>Quebec</span> region. During this time, options are available to inmates to connect with their family and support networks.</p>\n<p>We are committed to reducing the risks of COVID-19 in all of our operations and keeping inmates, our employees, and the public safe. We work with the Public Health Agency of <span>Canada</span> (PHAC), local public health, as well as unions and stakeholders to take any further steps needed to ensure everyone's safety.</p>\n<p>We continue to offer vaccines to inmates at all federal correctional institutions.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Quick Facts</span>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Drummond Institution is a medium security facility in <span>Drummondville, Quebec</span> , with a rated capacity of 369.
