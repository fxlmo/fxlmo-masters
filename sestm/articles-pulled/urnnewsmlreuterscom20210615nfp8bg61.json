We lowered the discount rate to reflect improved visibility in the ERRV segment and the increased share of long-term, contracted schedule of values [SOV] cashflows in the business.\"</p>\n              <p>In early 2018, the two put in place a \u20ac376m refinancing on the asset via RBC and NatWest split between bank debt and an institutional tranche.
