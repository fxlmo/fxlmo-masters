We are well positioned for the second half and are on track to deliver our dividend target, 6.6% higher than last year.\"\n    </p><p><strong>Performance<br/></strong></p><p>\n      The Company generated a total return of 10.6% on opening NAV for the first half of the year, substantially ahead of our target return of 8% to 10% per annum to be achieved over the medium term. The NAV per share increased to 291.2 pence. The portfolio overall is performing ahead of expectations, both financially and operationally, with our Investment Manager driving value growth over the period through active asset management of the portfolio. We were pleased to complete the acquisition of DNS:NET, a leading independent telecommunications provider in Germany, during the period, further improving the diversification of the portfolio.\n    </p><p>\n      The Company delivered a Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') of 4.2% in the period (FTSE 250: 8.4%). Since IPO, the Company's annualised TSR is 12.4%, comparing favourably with the broader market (FTSE 250: 7.9% annualised over the same period). The Company has achieved this long-term outperformance with a low correlation to the broader equity market.\n    </p><p><strong>Interim dividend</strong></p><p>\n      The Board is announcing an interim dividend of 5.225 pence per share, scheduled to be paid on 10 January 2022 to holders of ordinary shares on the register on 26 November 2021. The ex-dividend date will be 25 November 2021. As an investment trust, the Company is permitted to designate dividends wholly or partly as interest distributions for UK tax purposes. The Board is designating 2.0 pence of the 5.225 pence interim dividend as an interest distribution.\n    </p><p><strong>Corporate governance</strong></p><p>\n      The Company's Annual General Meeting was held on 8 July 2021. All resolutions were approved by shareholders, including the re-election of the existing Directors to the Board. Robert Jennings stepped down from the Board on 16 July 2021 and we thank him for his contribution to the Company.\n    </p><p><strong>Richard Laing</strong><br/>\n       Chair\n    </p><p><strong>-Ends-</strong></p><h4>\n      For further information, please contact:\n    </h4><p>\n      Thomas Fodor, investor enquiries<br/>\n       Tel: 020 7975 3469\n    </p><p>\n      Kathryn van der Kroft, press enquiries<br/>\n       Tel: 020 7975 3021\n    </p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>\n      This report contains Alternative Performance Measures ('APMs'), which are financial measures not defined in International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS').
