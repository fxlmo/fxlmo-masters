The NAV per share increased to\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          291.2 pence. The portfolio overall is performing ahead of expectations, both financially and operationally, with our Investment Manager driving value growth over the period through active asset management of the portfolio. We were pleased to complete the acquisition of DNS:NET, a leading independent telecommunications provider in Germany, during the period, further improving the diversification of the p ortfolio.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          1\n        </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <p>\n        The Company delivered a Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') of 4.2% in the period (FTSE 250: 8.4%).

The ex-dividend date will be 25 November 2021. As an investment trust, the Company is permitted to designate dividends wholly or partly as interest distributions for UK tax purposes. The Board is designating 2.0 pence of the 5.225 pence interim dividend as an interest distribution.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Corporate governance\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The Company's Annual General Meeting was held on 8 July 2021.

The Company remains well-funded and we are progressing several potential investment opportunities across our target markets.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Oystercatcher had an excellent first half of the year, outperforming both expectations and prior year, with continued high levels of utilisation across the portfolio of five terminals. On 23 September 2021, we signed an agreement for the sale of Oystercatcher's 45% stakes in its four European terminals in Amsterdam, Terneuzen, Ghent and Malta, together with the 55% stakes held by Oiltanking GmbH, to Evos Finance B.V.. The transaction completed on 29 October 2021. The majority of the net proceeds from the sale were used to prepay all of Oystercatcher's debt. The balance of the net proceeds to Oystercatcher, \u20ac55 million, were distributed to the Company. <span>O</span>ystercatcher continues to own a 45% stake in Oiltanking Singapore Limited alongside its partner Oiltanking GmbH. Singapore represented more than half of the carrying value of Oystercatcher prior to the sale.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Infinis performed ahead of expectations in the period, primarily due to outperformance in its captured landfill methane business, higher UK power prices and the frequent power supply system imbalances in the UK that benefitted its Power Response assets. Infinis has taken advantage of this higher power price environment to hedge the majority of its expected generation for the next two years at attractive prices. However, our longer-term power price forecasts are now lower than those in the March valuation, reflecting higher expected growth in renewable power generation in the UK and lower projected long-term commodity prices. Infinis has made solid progress on its development pipeline during the period with a 4MW solar site at Winterton receiving planning consent and a further 152MW of solar and battery energy storage sites at the planning or pre-planning stages. In June, Ofgem published its Significant Code Review 'minded to' decision, bringing greater clarity to the regulatory outlook and likely to result in reduced grid connection costs for new developments.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Tampnet demonstrated continued resilience during the period. North Sea customers continued to upgrade their bandwidth requirements. Progress with digital pilot projects in partnership with Microsoft are also showing real promise, highlighting the opportunity for Tampnet to capitalise on a wave of expected investment in remote digital operations by its offshore clients. In the Gulf of Mexico, the business experienced some delays in installations, primarily due to Covid-19 and severe weather conditions which also impacted customer operations at times. Despite those disruptions, recent roaming data usage is at record levels and the contracted revenue pipeline is growing. Tampnet appointed a new CEO, Elie Hanna, who joined in September 2021 from Ericsson. We believe he will bring a structured approach at an opportune time, particularly in relation to taking the various digitalisation initiatives to market effectively.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        For ESVAGT, the offshore wind market is gathering further momentum on the back of supportive government policies in both European countries and the USA. In parallel, the Service Operation Vessel ('SOV'), for which ESVAGT is market leader, is gaining acceptance as the preferred solution for offshore turbine maintenance due to the superior uptime results it underpins. ESVAGT is therefore ideally positioned to continue its growth in the offshore wind segment. During the period, ESVAGT successfully commenced operations with three new SOVs under long term charter with MHI Vestas, taking its operational wind SOV fleet to eight. ESVAGT also finalised its US SOV joint venture agreement with Crowley Maritime Corporation, the largest US Jones Act compliant operator, and has submitted its first US wind SOV bids through that joint venture. ESVAGT's Emergency Rescue and Response Vessel ('ERRV') fleet also achieved good results during the period. In particular, ESVAGT agreed an important contract with its largest ERRV customer, Total Energies, in Denmark, continuing as the preferred supplier on the Danish shelf. Fleet utilisation has also returned to pre-Covid levels, with contract rates strengthening accordingly. ESVAGT's strategy continues to focus on investment in new, contract-backed, wind SOV vessels to deliver growth, while managing its existing ERRV fleet to help fund that investment.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Ionisos performed strongly during the period, particularly in its pharmaceutical and testing segment. Ionisos is handling this increase in activity through optimising the product mix and taking steps to expand existing plants, which will also enable Ionisos to capture future growth in customer demand. The construction of a new sterilisation facility in Bautzen, Germany was completed in April in line with budget and one month ahead of schedule and a further site in Kleve, Germany is progressing towards completion in 2022. Further to the announcement in March 2021 that the facilities of Steril Milano, a subsidiary of Ionisos, had been closed, Steril Milano was placed into voluntary liquidation during the period. This was fully provided for in the March 2021 valuation of Ionisos. Steril Milano represented c.3% of Ionisos's 2020 EBITDA.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        3\n      </p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <p>\n        TCR performed strongly ahead of our expectations during the first half of the year as it continued to support its existing customers and realise cost efficiencies. This provides further evidence of the resilience of TCR's business model, even in the face of such a significant challenge to the air travel sector as Covid-19. During the period TCR successfully concluded new contracts, including strategic sale and lease back arrangements with Finnair in Helsinki and Gategroup across its European bases. European countries continued to roll out their vaccination programmes, which enabled a partial recovery of the air travel market over the summer months. We continue to see increased interest in TCR's full service rental model from customers that previously owned their own fleets of equipment.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Joulz outperformed in its core businesses of Infrastructure Services and Metering, with order intake for Infrastructure Services being especially strong. The solar energy business it acquired in April 2021 has seen sales of new solar rooftop installations grow ahead of expectations and the integration with the broader Joulz business has progressed well, although conversion of projects into operations has been slow in the period. Joulz's strategy to develop into a leading integrated energy transition solutions provider took a further step forward with the signing of a 'virtual grid' project for a large distribution centre development near Amsterdam. This project combines products from the Infrastructure Services, Metering and Solar business units and is underpinned by a long term contract. This is the first of an attractive pipeline of similar projects being developed by Joulz against a general background of grid congestion in the Netherlands.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The new investment in Berlin-based DNS:NET completed during the period and operationally has performed broadly in line with expectations. The current focus is on ramping up construction capacity and, during the period, DNS:NET signed a framework agreement with a key construction partner to deliver a substantial increase in the rate of homes being passed by the company's fibre network. Its sales pipeline is also growing and we are pleased to see continuing strong demand for DNS:NET's products on entering new areas.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Valorem had a good first half of the year, benefitting from better-than-forecast wind conditions and good turbine availability. It is progressing well with its construction activity, with a total of 90MW of wind and solar projects entering into operation during the period. Valorem continues to develop a large wind and solar pipeline, with its main focus being the development of Viiatti, a 300MW wind project in Finland expected to close in the first half of 2022. Its French and Greek pipelines continue to progress, although some French wind projects have experienced delays in the permitting process.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Attero performed well in the first half of the year. The waste supply volumes at its Energy from Waste ('EfW') plants were above last year and, by the end of the period, had recovered such that the business was able to run its EfW plants at full capacity without drawing on the company's waste buffer. Our valuation reflects a more conservative assumption for future net gate fee revenues based on recent market developments. The Organics business benefitted from favourable weather and new contract wins, which enabled it to fill the recent capacity expansion at the Wijster facility. The Minerals business is still seeing lower volumes than pre-Covid due to lower levels of construction activity, however gate fees for Minerals remain strong.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The availability-based Projects portfolio has performed in line with expectations.

We are also addressing other items identified in Environmental, Social and Governance assessments across the portfolio and progressing our sustainability-related objectives for FY22. The sustainability section of our Annual report and accounts 2022 will include a comprehensive review of our progress on sustainability, including emissions reporting for our portfolio companies.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        We refinanced our existing \u00a3300 million revolving credit facility ('RCF') on 3 November 2021 with a \u00a3400 million sustainability-linked RCF, following the Loan Market Association's Sustainability Linked Loan Principles. The new facility includes stretching targets across Environmental, Social and Governance themes aligned with our purpose. Performance against these targets will adjust the margin for the subsequent year. The term of the new facility is three years, with two one-year extension options. It also contains a \u00a3200 million accordion feature, in line with the previous facility, and we are pleased with the support received from our lenders and the terms we achieved.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Outlook\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Deal activity in the infrastructure sector has been high, reflecting resilient performance and significant available dry powder.
