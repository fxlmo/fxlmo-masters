Clover Sonoma believes organic dairy is about as good as it gets \u2013 along with limited ingredients, low sugar, high calcium, and the right ratio of carbs to protein. With no added sugar, 11 naturally occurring vitamins and minerals, vitamin D to support the immune system and ultra-pasteurized for longer shelf life (70 days), the two new Clover the Rainbow organic whole milks include:\n</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>\n<b>Lactose Free Organic Whole Milk (64 oz.):</b> High in calcium, 8 grams of protein per serving and no added sugar. Since milk contains a natural sugar called lactose, Clover Sonoma adds a lactase enzyme to fresh organic milk that breaks down the lactose into two easily digestible sugars, glucose and galactose, making it easy-to-digest for sensitive tummies and kids who are lactose intolerant.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>DHA Omega-3 with Choline Organic Whole Milk (64 oz.): </b>100mg Choline to support brain health, 50mg DNA Omega-3 and 8 grams of protein per serving. This new milk also helps boost memory, mood and cognitive development - making it a smart beverage choice for all members of the family to enjoy, but especially for growing minds.\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n\u201cTo power their boundless energy, curiosity and brilliance, kids need whole nutrition,\u201d said Clover Sonoma Chief Growth Officer Kristel Corson. \u201cThe power of whole milk offers whole nutrition to kids\u2019 growing brains and bodies throughout the day. Our new Clover the Rainbow organic plus whole milks \u2013 Lactose Free and DHA Omega-3 with Choline \u2013 offer our high-quality milk for lactose intolerant tummies and the option for an additional brain health boost with OMEGA-3. In kids\u2019 dairy, many brands speak to nutrition, organic and sustainable, and some speak to humane, but Clover the Rainbow speaks to all three.\u201d\n</p><p>\nClover Sonoma\u2019s milk is not just organic, it\u2019s organic plus.
