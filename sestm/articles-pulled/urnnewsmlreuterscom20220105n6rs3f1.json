Stellantis and Amazon will collaborate to deploy Amazon\u2019s technology and software expertise across Stellantis\u2019 organization, including vehicle development, building connected in-vehicle experiences, and training the next generation of automotive software engineers. Together, the two companies will create a suite of software-based products and services that seamlessly integrate with customers\u2019 digital lives and add value over time through regular over-the-air (OTA) software updates.</p><p>\"Over the past two decades, Amazon has built the technology, expertise, and culture of innovation to be a world leader in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We\u2019ve used these capabilities to make life better for customers around the world through products and services like Alexa, Kindle, and Fire TV, and with AWS we\u2019ve helped thousands of companies transform themselves and their industries. We\u2019re excited to collaborate with Stellantis to transform the automotive industry and re-invent the in-vehicle experience,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. \u201cWe are inventing solutions that will help enable Stellantis to accelerate connected and personalized in-vehicle experiences, so that every moment in motion can be smart, safe, and tailored to each occupant. Together, we will create the foundation for Stellantis to transform from a traditional automaker into a global leader in software-driven development and engineering.\"</p><p>\u201cWorking together with Amazon is an integral part of our capability building roadmap, based on both developing internal competencies and decisive collaborations with tech leaders, and it will bring significant expertise to one of our key technology platforms, STLA SmartCockpit,\u201d said Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis. \u201cBy leveraging artificial intelligence and cloud solutions, we will transform our vehicles into personalized living spaces and enhance the overall customer experience, making our vehicles the most wanted, most captivating place to be, even when not driving.\u201d</p><p>The collaboration brings together Amazon's leadership and innovation in digital experiences, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with Stellantis\u2019 automotive engineering excellence and portfolio of 14 iconic vehicle brands.\u00a0Stellantis outlined its software strategy during its <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4FKhvtH5v4wGmOwQYbBpYt77dZyMQd98RnO4dvnn8v4uM9jt28tnaU8MjUb5UcuUNbHLPPk1CGhtTCAoxsBJ12cgDohlhAKEk_3sJzVG7Cwi1jLOFm8_Ql8BrqJxKeV5\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Software Day</a> program in December 2021.</p><p>The collaboration will focus on several areas.</p><p><strong>STLA SmartCockpit</strong><br/>Amazon and Stellantis will collaborate to deliver software for STLA SmartCockpit, which will run in millions of Stellantis vehicles globally starting in 2024.
