The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch and join the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal, which also consists of three Availability Zones. Globally, AWS has 81 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions, with plans to launch 27 more Availability Zones and nine more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. The upcoming AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will enable even more developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, to run their applications and serve end users from data centers located in Canada. AWS also released an <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.awscloud.com%2Frs%2F112-TZM-766%2Fimages%2FGEN_aws-economic-impact-canada_Nov-2021.pdf&amp;esheet=52524624&amp;newsitemid=20211108005823&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=economic+impact+study+%28EIS%29&amp;index=2&amp;md5=56a30723e1dc8f91b1974c06226c309b\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">economic impact study (EIS)</a> estimating that the company\u2019s spending on construction and the operation of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal will together create more than 5,000 new jobs with an estimated investment of over $17 billion (CA$21 billion) in the local economies by 2037. Both infrastructure Regions will add an estimated $31.6 billion (CA$39 billion) to Canada\u2019s GDP over the same time period.

With another AWS Region in Canada, customers will see even lower latency for emerging solutions like 5G-enabled applications and machine learning at the edge, and it will strengthen their ability to architect their regional infrastructure for even greater fault tolerance, resiliency, and availability,\u201d said Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President of Infrastructure Services at AWS. \u201cWe are excited to build world-class infrastructure to help organizations reinvent how they deliver customer solutions and fuel economic growth.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cThis major investment from AWS again demonstrates that Alberta is establishing itself as a dominant player in digital technology and innovation. This multibillion-dollar data center project in our province underscores the work being done by Invest Alberta to create jobs and diversify the economy,\u201d said Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. \u201cI look forward to working with AWS on this project and seeing how it will strengthen Alberta\u2019s information technology and communication sector.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers\u2019 business continuity but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will enable customers with data residency preferences to securely store data in Canada while providing even lower latency across the country and more flexibility to run applications across multiple Regions.\n</p><p>\nOverall, AWS is estimated to invest over $17 billion (CA$21 billion) in Canada by 2037 through the construction and operation of its two infrastructure Regions. This AWS infrastructure investment is expected to increase Canada\u2019s GDP by approximately more than $31 billion (CA$39 billion) over the same time period. In the newly announced AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS plans to invest over $3 billion (CA$4 billion)<span> </span>by 2037, which includes capital expenditures on the construction of data centers, operational expenses such as ongoing utilities and facility costs, and purchases of goods and services from regional businesses. The EIS also estimates that the new AWS Region will bring direct and indirect economic benefits like new employment and sales for the data center supply chain and related sectors in Canada. In total, investment in the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region is estimated to create more than 950 new full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in Canada.\n</p><p>\n<b>Customers and AWS Partners Welcome the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region</b>\n</p><p>\nCustomers in Canada will join the millions of active customers using AWS every month in over 190 countries around the world.

We see the value in using the latest technology to serve our citizens, and this new AWS Region in western Canada will help us and many other organizations unlock innovation.\u201d\n</p><p>\nKidoodle.TV is a Calgary-based children\u2019s streaming service with more than 100 million downloads in 235 countries and territories worldwide. \u201cI\u2019ve been using AWS in the media and entertainment industry for so long that I can\u2019t imagine a world without it. It\u2019s integral to our ability to release new features and products quickly,\u201d said Daniel Riddell, Chief Technology Officer at Kidoodle.TV. \u201cBecause the AWS Cloud existed when we started this company, we could build everything off premises. We didn\u2019t have the need for huge overhead costs. We could build essentially the same service architecture that multibillion-dollar companies were able to deploy. When COVID hit, our numbers spiked. We used AWS Elemental MediaTailor and other AWS services to scale up our monthly active users by 3,200% in one year and quickly pivot our ad delivery process.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAthabasca University (AU), Canada\u2019s Online University, is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online and open education institutions serving more than 43,000 students across 87 countries. AU became the first Canadian post-secondary institution to move its entire digital operational infrastructure to AWS last year. \u201cI like to say that \u2018there is no innovation at scale without a solid foundation.\u2019 AU\u2019s move to AWS in 2020 was the foundation of our digital transformation strategy, providing the infrastructure and cost savings that will allow us to make personalized learning for our students an infinitely scalable reality,\u201d said Jennifer Schaeffer, AU Vice President of Information Technology and Chief Information Officer. \u201cNot only have we transformed our digital foundation, but we\u2019ve also moved cloud into the forefront with our curriculum. We are helping train the next generation of cloud professionals through the AU PowerEDTM and AWS Academy Cloud Foundations programs.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAs one of Canada\u2019s largest independent midstream companies, Keyera operates an integrated energy infrastructure business with extensive interconnected assets.

We recognize the need for digital innovation as a way to provide our customers with increased accuracy and reliability. Working with AWS, we built a new machine learning application that proactively identifies issues in metering, which enables us to respond and react within days compared to weeks. To date, we have seen significant metering improvements for Keyera and our customers, and based on this success, we are expanding its deployment to two additional facilities,\u201d said Kelly Hill, Vice President of Information Technology at Keyera. \u201cWorking with AWS means we have built a digital innovation platform for our current and future needs. AWS Professional Services is helping us transform our digital business through new applications and services such as Amazon Rekognition for asset tracking using computer vision, and other services like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon QuickSight for business intelligence and dashboarding in our measurement initiative. We\u2019re excited to continue collaborating with AWS to advance our innovation journey.\u201d\n</p><p>\nBorn on AWS, Neo Financial is a financial tech startup that uses the elasticity of the AWS Cloud to scale its business. \u201cWhen we launched in 2019, we needed a cloud provider to help us scale and meet the regulatory requirements we face as a financial services company. Our customers also have compliance mandates that require their data to be kept in Canada,\u201d said Kris Read, co-founder and CTO at Neo Financial. \u201cToday, we use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for our core infrastructure and Amazon Simple Storage Service for its highly durable storage. We also have improved security with Amazon GuardDuty and improved performance for our customers with Amazon CloudFront.\u201d\n</p><p>\nCanada-based partners are part of the AWS Partner Network (APN), which includes over 100,000 independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world.

In April 2021, Amazon announced its first renewable energy project in Canada\u2014an 80 megawatt (MW) solar project in the County of Newell in Alberta. Once complete, the project will contribute an estimated 195,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy to the grid, which is enough energy to power more than 18,000 Canadian homes for a year. In June 2021, Amazon announced its second and largest renewable energy project in Canada\u2014a 375 MW solar farm in Vulcan, Alberta. When it comes online next year, the project will bring Amazon\u2019s capacity in Canada to more than 1 million MWhs, which is enough to power more than 100,000 Canadian homes for a year. These projects will contribute to powering Amazon\u2019s global infrastructure.
