They are responsible for 90% of the poleward transport of moisture on our planet. Thousands of miles long but only a few hundred miles wide, atmospheric rivers often appear on satellite imagery as elongated tendrils of moisture stretching from the tropics to the mid-latitudes.</p><p>When an atmospheric river makes landfall, often through interactions with mid-latitude cyclones, extreme flooding events can occur. The features act as a conveyor belt feeding huge amounts of tropical moisture into weather systems, intensifying the rainfall.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Perhaps the most famous example of atmospheric rivers is the \"Pineapple Express\", which can deposit huge amounts of rainfall (and sometimes snow) to Pacific coastal regions of the US.</p><p>The effects of atmospheric rivers are also felt in the UK. On 4 and 5 December 2015, interactions between an atmospheric river and Storm Desmond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/storm-desmond-damage-cumbria-estimated-500m\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">led to record-breaking rainfall across north-west England</a> . With the enhanced moisture supply, orographic rainfall across Cumbria broke the 24-hour UK rainfall record, with 341.4mm (13.4in) falling in Honister Pass.</p><p>Such huge rainfall totals led to the flooding of 5,200 properties in Lancashire and Cumbria, with a further 1,000 properties flooded in the Scottish Borders.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated</p></div>"}
