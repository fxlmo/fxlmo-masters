Snort has a long history and is the most recommended, de facto intrusion prevention engine in the industry which is in the hall of fame of greatest open-source software of all time. Snort is widely used, in several of our own products including Cisco Secure Firewall, Cisco Umbrella, Meraki MX, and used by other industry partners. It is also available as a stand-alone open-source</span>\n                  <a href=\"https://snort.org/\">\n                    <span>package</span>\n                  </a>\n                  <span>.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>The time has come to send Snorty, our pig mascot, on another journey to secure the container revolution\u2026</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>\n                    <strong>The Container Revolution</strong>\n                  </span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>The past couple of years there has been a tremendous increase in demand for container technologies, and the need to consume capabilities in a containerized form factor. This has fueled the evolution of Cloud Native architectures both on-prem and in the cloud.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>As a natural reaction, everyone in the market has started to deliver container-based solutions to satisfy customer needs. Some of the most popular solutions leverage Docker and Kubernetes technologies.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>A short clarification here if you're lost: Docker itself is an open-source technology (and container file format) which provides a way to containerize applications. It allows you to build and run containers while you develop them. When you have so many containers that you can't handle them, that's where Kubernetes become effective. It provides an ecosystem to deal with scaling, complexity, self-healing, deploying, and orchestrating your containers across multiple servers.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>One more technology worth mentioning is called Helm. It plays a key role in the solution described below. Quoting from</span>\n                  <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/topics/architecture/\">\n                    <span>Helm's site</span>\n                  </a>\n                  <span>: \"Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes packages called charts.\" In essence, you can use Helm charts to bundle all the information required for Kubernetes to instantiate containers. (Think about bootstrap parameters, dependency management, release metadata for lifecycle management.)</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>\n                    <strong>The Challenge</strong>\n                  </span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>Recently, the growth of distribution channels for containers has made it challenging for customers to consume these products from a single secure and trusted catalogue. If you have hybrid-cloud (a mix of on-prem and cloud) environments - the challenge is even greater.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>In more technical terms, there are many different \"Artifact Registries\" that customers can use in their Kubernetes deployments to access/consume/deploy different solutions provided in a container form factor.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>This creates multiple challenges for procurement, security, compliance, and finance teams to manage all the relations, contracts, certify container applications, and release them for consumption in production environments. The pain this challenge creates will only worsen over time, if not addressed.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>\n                    <strong>The Solution</strong>\n                  </span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>With the latest addition to AWS Marketplace, which is called \"Containers Anywhere\" - AWS took a bold step to offer a</span>\n                  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/containers\">\n                    <span>solution</span>\n                  </a>\n                  <span>for the above-mentioned challenges customers face.</span>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <span>With the help of AWS Marketplace Container Anywhere - customers can browse, subscribe to, and deploy third party Kubernetes applications through the marketplace.
