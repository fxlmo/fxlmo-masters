The deal is expected to be rated Baa2/BBB- by Moody\u2019s/S&amp;P.</p>\n              <p>\"When you've got a book of \u00a31.7bn-\u00a31.8bn for a \u00a3210m maximum size, you feel as if you might have started a little wide, but the 6% was eye-catching and got the right momentum,\" said a banker at one of the leads.</p>\n              <p>\"There was a healthy debate this morning about whether it could start in the high 5s and have a chance to get close to 5%, but it is an age old debate - if you start at 6% you can get 75bp, but if you start at 5.75% are you going to get that same 75bp leverage? This is ending up where it should end up.\"</p>\n              <p>The lead banker added that the deal benefited from the best market conditions of the last two weeks, suggesting the conducive backdrop allowed them to shave off an additional 25bp from the price.\u00a0</p>\n              <p>He said the composition of the order book was broadly similar to that of a traditional sterling AT1, with good participation from abrdn's fellow asset managers.</p>\n              <p>\"One thing it doesn't have is some of the fast money accounts - I think it's slightly better quality than the average bank AT1 book,\" he said, adding that the demand bodes well for the deal's performance in the secondary market.\u00a0</p>\n              <p>\"This should be locked down because it is really a museum piece and I don't think there will be a raft of these deals coming behind. Even if there were four or five asset managers wanting to do similar deals, they would be limited on the size they could do.\"</p>\n              <p>Bankers suggested a sizeable buffer to the deal's equity conversion trigger helped investors to get comfortable with the new product. The trigger will first be set at 7% of abrdn's risk weighted assets, but will switch to 70% of the own funds requirement under new Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR) rules that will apply from January 1 2022, translating to a buffer of around \u00a3900m.</p>\n              <p>Market participants also pointed to some advantageous features of the deal when compared with bank AT1s. Unlike with traditional AT1s, there are no maximum distributable amount restrictions applicable and the deal does not feature statutory point of non-viability loss absorption.</p>\n              <p>Abrdn announced the mandate for the deal last Thursday on the same day it confirmed it will buy interactive investor, an online investment platform, for \u00a31.49bn.</p>\n              <p>Abrdn said the acquisition, which will be funded by available cash from its capital reserves, will increase its assets under management fivefold to \u00a369bn and more than double its revenue to \u00a3199m.</p>\n              <p>The AT1 is aimed at optimising abrdn's capital under the new IFPR rules. While abrdn's Tier 2 bucket is already filled, it has scope for around \u00a3200m of the total capital requirement to be met by AT1.</p>\n              <p>(Reporting by Tom Revell, editing by Helene Durand, Sudip Roy)</p>\n              <p>((tom.revell@refinitiv.com; +44 (0) 7557 138961))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
