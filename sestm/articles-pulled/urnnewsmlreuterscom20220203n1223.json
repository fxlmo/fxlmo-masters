In fact, Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII), says that sometimes they can force skittish investors to run for the hills, rather than see them as opportunities.</p><p>As Wren sees it, since the S&amp;P 500 <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=.SPX\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\".SPX\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">.SPX</a> recently broke below its closely-watched 200-day moving average on Jan. 21, and then subsequently reclaimed on Jan. 31, it's been a battle between traders seeking short-term profits and investors taking advantage of weakness to step in and buy equities.</p><p>Traders have their place, Wren said in a note on Wednesday, but a key piece of the puzzle on market pullbacks depends on your forward outlook, and WFII's remains \"positive.\"</p><p>Looking out over the balance of 2022, WFII sees good economic growth, decelerating inflation, an improving labor market and strong corporate earnings growth. Therefore, WFII wants to \"step in and be buyers when the stock market corrects.\"</p><p>Given that outlook, Wren continues to recommend both tech and communication services for \"quality and growth components of portfolios.\"</p><p>In addition, Wren says investors can look to boost exposure to two cyclical sectors: financials and industrials. As for fixed income, Wren says favor municipal bonds and preferreds.</p><p>\"In the current environment, expect more days where trader-induced volatility is met with buying coming from longer-term investors looking to take advantage of opportunities. We recommend being a buyer,\" said.</p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>SICK OF OMICRON?
