Reputable businesses will get your permission to send you a text before sending anything to your inbox. Fake texts often contain suspicious-looking links and contain typos and other errors too. <br/> \u00a0</li><li>Watch out for rewards that sound too good to be true. If someone offers you a valuable product or gift card in exchange for completing a two-minute survey, it's probably a scam. <br/> \u00a0</li><li>Limited-time offers could be a red flag.\u00a0Scammers often use a sense of urgency to get their victims to hand over valuable information without thinking. <br/> \u00a0</li><li>Remember that scammers conceal their identity.\u00a0Many scam surveys are very vague about their purpose and who is running them. If you can't figure out who or where the survey is coming from, don't take it. <br/> \u00a0</li><li>Do some research.\u00a0If you aren't sure about a survey, do an internet search to find out more information. Look for links to the survey on a business's official website.</li> </ol><p>\"Your best\u00a0defense is to\u00a0ignore the pitch\u2014and your second best defense is to\u00a0slow down and take time to look for\u00a0third-party\u00a0validation that the offer and the sender are legitimate.\u00a0One quick way to verify is to search using the string 'Is [XYZ survey or discount] a\u00a0scam?'\u00a0before\u00a0you give out any information about yourself,\"\u00a0Walsh\u00a0says.</p><p><span><span>Michelle Shen is a Money &amp; Tech Digital Reporter for USA TODAY.
