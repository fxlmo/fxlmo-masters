(the \"Company\" or \"WonderFi\") today announced\nthe launch date of the WonderFi App, a simple and free app that makes it\neasy for everyday users to access the high-growth area of decentralized\nfinance (\"DeFi\"). The WonderFi app will be released on desktop on January\n25, 2022, with mobile app releases to follow.\n\n   \"The WonderFi app empowers anyone with a mobile phone to access DeFi,\nregardless of their background or experience in the sector,\" said WonderFi\nCEO Ben Samaroo. \"We're committed to providing fair and equal access to\nDeFi and lowering the barriers to entry for everyone.\"\n\n   DeFi is a new technology which cuts out the middleman in traditional\ncentralized finance, like banks and brokerages. With the total locked value\n(TVL) of DeFi markets having tripled over the last year to nearly $85\nbillion, interest in cryptocurrency has ramped up, with investors drawn to\nthe ease of conducting their own transactions and the high earnings\npotential. But for most consumers, DeFi is overwhelming and difficult to\naccess - an exclusive area of finance accessible to only experts and\ntraders.\n\n   WonderFi is backed by strategic investors such as Alameda Research and\nFTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, and Gen-Z influencer\nand investor Josh Richards.\n\n   \"DeFi can be extremely complex-it's not 'consumerized' in the way that\ntraditional banking and investments are, and managing compliance and risk\ncan be an issue, so it's out of reach for most people. When my own daughter\ncame to me looking to invest in DeFi, there was no feasible way for her to\nget started,\" said O'Leary. \"WonderFi has solved that problem with a\nplatform that makes it easy for anyone to get started, to earn more and\nmanage all of their assets in one trusted platform.\"\n\n   Additional Information\nFor additional information, please contact:\n\n   WonderFi Technologies Inc.\nBen Samaroo, CEO\nben@wonder.fi\n(778) 843-9637\n\n   Investor Relations Contact: invest@wonder.fi\nMedia Contact: press@wonder.fi\n\n   ABOUT WONDERFI\n   WonderFi is a leading technology company with the mission of creating\nbetter access to DeFi through the core principles of simplicity and\neducation.
