That's because there is enough strength in more heavily-weighted components to keep the market moving higher.</pre><pre>That strength isn't robust, but it's just enough with Apple (AAPL 150.76, +1.80, +1.2%) and Microsoft (MSFT 332.12, +2.75, +0.8%) in a leadership position. The leader of the day, however, is Avis Budget Group (CAR 410.00, +238.54, +139%), which is soaring in an epic short-covering rally after the rental car company blew past consensus earnings estimates for the third quarter.</pre><pre>The move in CAR powered a 14.2% gain (just today) in the Dow Jones Transportation Average earlier, moving it into record territory along with the Dow, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 400, and Russell 2000. The DJTA is now up \"only\" 10.6% since CAR is up \"only\" 139% now after being up as much as 218%.</pre><pre>We're not sure if this move will eventually drive a sheepish realization that the stock market is getting ahead of itself, but if there was any move that might, it could be this one, thereby driving some pent-up selling interest as the day progresses.</pre><pre>For now, though, the broader market is being supported by gains in eight out of 11 sectors. The only laggards are consumer discretionary (-0.7%), which was up 12.4% for the quarter entering today, energy (-0.6%), which was up 11.9% for the quarter entering today, and utilities (-0.5%), which was up 5.1% for the quarter entering today.</pre><pre>Today's action comes in front of tomorrow's FOMC directive, which is expected to include news of a tapering plan for the Fed's asset purchase program but nothing that suggests a hike in the fed funds rate is happening anytime soon. This recognition that the Fed isn't going to stand in the stock market's way with a rate hike soon has helped stir animal spirits that have led to outsized gains since early October.</pre><pre>Accordingly, the risk on Wednesday would be a directive, or a comment from Fed Chair Powell, that implies the Fed is thinking it may need to pull forward its tightening action. That's a low probability as the market sees it, which is why it is a heightened risk.</pre><pre>The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3%; the Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000 are up 0.2%.</pre><pre>11:17</pre><pre>RL Ralph Lauren shares -6.5% despite beating Q2 estimates and providing upside guidance this morning\n(121.31 -8.44)</pre><pre>RL provided upside Q3 revs guidance of +14-16% (implying $1.63-1.66 bln vs $1.61 consensus)The Co also raised FY revs outlook to +34-36% (implying $5.89-5.985 bln vs $5.77 bln consensus) from prior range of +25-30%</pre><pre>11:11</pre><pre>D Dominion Energy is aware of a fraudulent news release circulating this morning regarding the company's earnings (halted)\n(75.04 -0.37)</pre><pre>The company has previously announced its third-quarter 2021 earnings call will take place at 10 a.m. ET on Friday, Nov. 5, 2021.

Ocular redness scores in the reproxalap group were observed to be statistically lower than those of vehicle. Additionally, Schirmer's test scores assessed after the first dose were directionally in favor of reproxalap over vehicle and approached statistical significance. Mean visual analog scale ocular dryness and ocular discomfort scores were lower in reproxalap-treated subjects than in vehicle-treated subjects at all of the 18 time points when symptoms were assessed in the dry eye chamber, including the first time point in the chamber, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Tear RASP level results from the trial are expected to be available later this quarter. Consistent with the clinical experience of reproxalap in more than 1,300 patients, there were no observed safety or tolerability concerns in the trial; the most common adverse event was mild and transient instillation site discomfort lasting less than one minute and similar to many prescribed topical ophthalmic medications for anterior segment inflammation.</pre><pre>08:08</pre><pre>IMMP Immutep receives patent for eftilagimod alpha in China\n(4.35 )</pre><pre>Immutep announced the grant of a new patent (number ZL 201610221687) entitled \"Use of recombinant LAG-3 or the derivatives thereof for eliciting a monocyte immune response\" by the Chinese Patent Office.

Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points. The 53rd week is still expected to represent approximately 140 basis points of this year's revenue growth. The Company continues to expect operating margin for Fiscal 2022 of about 12.0% to 12.5%. This compares to operating margin of 4.8% in the prior year period and 10.3% in Fiscal 2020. Gross margin is now expected to increase at the high end of previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points to last year, with stronger AUR growth and favorable product mix more than offsetting increased freight headwinds. Operating expenses continue to reflect the Company's plans to increase marketing and other strategic investments to support long-term growth, including a higher level of spend in the second half of the fiscal year. For third quarter Fiscal 2022, revenues are expected to increase approximately 14% to 16% in constant currency to last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 140 basis points. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected in the range of 13.0% to 13.5%, roughly in-line with last year, with modest gross margin expansion partly offset by a shift in the timing of investments from the second quarter, increased freight expenses, normalizing channel mix shift compared to the prior year's COVID disruptions and about 30 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency.</pre><pre>07:58</pre><pre>WRAPX S&amp;P futures vs fair value: +9.20.

A number above 50.0% is indicative of expansion. October marked the 17th straight month of expansion for the manufacturing sector.The key takeaway from the report is still the same. Demand is strong, but manufacturers and suppliers continue to struggle to meet increasing demand levels due to a range of factors that includes record-long raw material lead times, shortages of basic materials, transportation difficulties, worker absenteeism, and difficulty filling positions.Total construction spending declined 0.5% month-over-month in September (Briefing.com consensus +0.5%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from 0.0%) in August. Total private construction declined 0.5% month-over-month while total public construction spending decreased 0.7%.The key takeaway from the report is the continued decline seen in new single family and multifamily construction. That is most likely the consequence of ongoing supply chain pressures and higher costs for builders that are standing in the way of building more affordable homes.The final IHS Market Manufacturing PMI for September checked in at 58.4, down from 60.7 in the preliminary reading.</pre><pre>There are is no economic data of note scheduled for Tuesday.</pre><pre>S&amp;P 500 +22.8% YTDNasdaq Composite +21.0% YTDRussell 2000 +19.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.3% YTD</pre><pre>16:21</pre><pre>SMLR Semler Scientific misses by $0.19, misses of revs\n(149.76 -0.23)</pre><pre>Reports Q3 (Sep) EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.70 S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus; revs of $14 mln vs. $15.06 mln S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus.</pre><pre>16:20</pre><pre>HLIT Harmonic beats by $0.02, beats on revs; raises FY21 EPS, revs guidance\n(9.33 +0.26)</pre><pre>Reports Q3 (Sep) earnings of $0.05 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.03; revenues rose 33.1% year/year to $126.32 mln vs the $118.62 mln S&amp;P Capital IQ Consensus.
