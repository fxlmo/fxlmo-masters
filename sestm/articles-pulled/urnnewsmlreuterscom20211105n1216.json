Google-parent Alphabet <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=GOOGL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"GOOGL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">GOOGL.O</a>, for instance, trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.6, compared to a valuation of 21.1 for the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>Apple Inc <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AAPL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AAPL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AAPL.O</a> is valued at 26.2 forward earnings, while the information technology sector, up nearly 28% this year, carries a forward P/E of 26.4.</p><p><span class=\"tr-strong\">While gains in big technology stocks have boosted the S&amp;P for more than a decade now, their heavy weighting could sink the index if tech falls</span> out of favor. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, Wall Street's three most valuable companies, account for close to 15% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization, according to Refinitiv Datastream. </p><p>Fund managers in last month's BoFA Global Research Survey named \u201clong tech\u201d as the market\u2019s most crowded trade and had collectively reduced their \u201coverweight\u201d positions in tech stocks to the lowest level since May. The market\u2019s top four most crowded individual stocks are Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, according to a recent analysis by research firm Bernstein, incorporating factors such as institutional ownership and price momentum. </p><p>Limiting exposure to tech stocks over the last decade has tended to hurt portfolio performance over the long run, making investors wary of cutting their holdings too drastically. Still, some are looking to broaden their portfolios to reduce their exposure to the sector\u2019s biggest names. </p><p>Garret Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, believes large technology company stocks may be vulnerable to investors seeking to lock in profits and move some funds to other sectors. Melton is buying shares in financial and energy companies, which he believes will benefit from rising inflation and a strong economic recovery. </p><p>\"We're in the camp that the growth rate in the economy is being under-appreciated this year and next year,\" Melson said.</p><p>Analysts at DataTrek Research believe sectors that can benefit from rising growth, including financials and energy companies, are likely to challenge big tech stocks into year-end. </p><p>\u201cTechnology has been a winning group for many years, and we expect it will continue to be so in the future,\u201d they wrote in a Friday report. \u201cBut as investors consider where to allocate capital today \u2026 we think it likely they will seek out sectors with more exposure to improving economic fundamentals.\u201d</p><p>Strong U.S. employment numbers on Friday brightened the economic outlook, as did news of a promising experimental antiviral drug from Pfizer <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=PFE.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"PFE.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">PFE.N</a>.
