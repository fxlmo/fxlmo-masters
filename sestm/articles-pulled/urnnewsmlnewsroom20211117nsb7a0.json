The ESE Statement, which is anticipated for submission to the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board (\"YESAB\") in the second quarter of 2023, is a key component in YESAB's assessment process for the proposed Casino Project.</p>\n<p>Hemmera is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc. with primary office locations in <span>Vancouver</span> , <span>Whitehorse</span> , <span>Burnaby</span> , <span>Victoria</span> , <span>Calgary</span> , <span>Toronto</span> , and <span>Halifax</span> and a strong project presence in Northern and <span>Western Canada</span> . Hemmera is managing the regulatory process for Newmont Corporation's Coffee Gold Mine Project (\"Coffee\"). Earlier this year, YESAB issued its recommendation that Coffee proceed.
