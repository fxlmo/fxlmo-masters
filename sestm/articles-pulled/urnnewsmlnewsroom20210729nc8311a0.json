Q1 of last year was impacted by the start of Covid, but even after adjusting for these effects, our Q1'22 revenue growth rates for the Group, service segments and reporting regions were all ahead of Q4'21 trends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>We have posted strong double-digit growth across voice (26.0%), data (37.4%) and mobile money (53.7%), and across all our regions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sub-Saharan Africa is now experiencing a third wave of the pandemic. Governments are implementing balanced measures of lockdowns and restrictions. But vaccinations levels remain very low. In these challenging times our business model has so far proven resilient, but we continue to monitor the situation closely for the potential impact on local economies and consumers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Our total customer base has returned to growth with acceleration in our East Africa and Francophone regions and despite continuing negative net additions in Nigeria. With the easing of these restrictions in late April we have since been able to gradually increase locations for activations in line with regulatory compliance across Nigeria, and we have begun adding new customers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Our continued focus on modernisation and rollout of our network, along with simplifying our products and improving our distribution, have all helped us to make handsome gains on our ARPUs across voice, data and mobile money. Our robust operating model and solid execution should enable us to continue our profitable growth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>We continue to see huge potential across voice, data and mobile money due to the low penetration levels in Africa, as we continue to partner the nations in bridging the digital divide and enhancing financial inclusion. We remain committed to continue to efficiently and effectively deliver services that help to improve the lives, communities and economies we serve.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>---</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Airtel Africa plc (\"Airtel Africa\" or \"Group\") results for the quarter ended 30 June 2021 are unaudited and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the same period.

class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Our continued focus on execution of our strategy has helped us to deliver another strong set of results for Q1'22. Our revenue growth was more than 30% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 33.1%, with a strong performance across both our regional segments and our key services.</span>\n<span>Revenue growth for the quarter partially benefitted from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during</span>\n<span>the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region. Even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates were ahead of Q4'21 trends for the Group, and across all service segments and reporting regions.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Regionally, revenue in Nigeria grew by 38.2%, in East Africa by 32.8% and in Francophone Africa by 24.9%.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>By service segment, mobile services revenue grew by 29.8% in constant currency (27.4% in reported currency), with voice revenue up 26.0%, and data revenue up 37.4%; and mobile money services revenue grew by 53.7% (52.8% in reported currency).</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Net finance costs were broadly stable. Tax charges increased by $62m due to higher operating profit, a one-time tax charge and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries, with the prior period also benefitting from deferred tax credit recognition.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Basic EPS and EPS before exceptional items significantly improved to 3.3 cents and 3.2 cents respectively, with higher operating profits more than offsetting the increased tax and broadly stable net finance cost and minority interest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Leverage also improved year on year, to 1.8x at 30 June 2021 from 2.2x at 30 June 2020, despite investing $247m of intangible capex renewing licences in two of our largest markets, Nigeria and Uganda, and acquiring additional spectrum. The increase in underlying EBITDA more than offset the increase in net debt.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>GAAP measures</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Revenue</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Revenue grew by 30.7% to $1,112m in reported currency, driven by constant currency growth of 33.1% partially offset by currency devaluations, mainly in the Nigerian naira (6%) and Zambian kwacha (24.2%), in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc (6.6%) and Ugandan shilling (5.3%). Revenue growth for the quarter partially benefitted from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region <span>.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Operating profit</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Operating profit increased by 67.6% to $352m in reported currency, due to a combination of strong revenue growth and improvements in operating efficiency. In constant currency operating profit grew by 73.9%.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Net finance costs</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Net finance costs were broadly stable in the period. Effective interest rate increased to 5.0% from 4.7% in the prior year largely as a result of reduction in foreign currency debt and increase in local currency OpCo debt, however interest charges were broadly stable due to lower market debt and slightly higher interest income.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Taxation</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Total tax charges increased by $62m, to $117m. The $62m increase in tax charges was due to higher operating profit, a one-time tax case settlement charge of $9m in one of our operating markets and higher withholding tax of $4m on dividends by subsidiaries. The prior period also benefited from the recognition of deferred tax credit of $7m in Tanzania.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Profit after tax</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Profit after tax was $142m, a 148.7% increase on the $57m of the prior period. This increase was largely due to higher operating profits along with stable net finance costs, which more than offset the increase in tax charges due to increased profits.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Basic EPS</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Basic EPS was 3.3 cents, up from 1.1 cents in the prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset the increased tax charges from higher profits. Net finance cost and minority interest were broadly stable.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Alternative performance measures</span>\n</span>\n<span>[1]</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Revenue</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Constant currency revenue growth of 33.1% was driven by the customer base growth of 8.4% to 120.8 million, and ARPU growth of 22.9%. The slowdown in customer base growth was due to new SIM registration regulations in Nigeria; excluding Nigeria, our customer base grew by 15.9%. The overall ARPU growth of 22.9% was driven by all service segments; with voice contributing 8.7%, data 8.3%, mobile money 4.0%, and the balance coming from other revenue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Revenue growth was recorded across all our regions. Revenue in Nigeria grew by 38.2%, in East Africa by 32.8% and in Francophone Africa by 24.9%.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Revenue in each of our service segments grew by more than 25%. Revenue for voice grew by 26.0%, for data by 37.4%, and for mobile money by 53.7% (all in constant currency).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Revenue growth for the quarter partially benefitted from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region <span>.</span>\n</span>\n<span>Even after adjusting for this, revenue growth rates were ahead of Q4'21 trends for the Group, and across all reporting regions and service segments.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Underlying EBITDA</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Underlying EBITDA was $534m, an increase of 42.4% in reported currency and 46.2% in constant currency. The growth in underlying EBITDA was driven by revenue growth of 33.1% (in constant currency) and improved operating efficiency. The underlying EBITDA margin was 48.0%, an improvement of 396 basis points in reported currency and 428 basis points in constant currency.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $14.3m on revenue and $8.9m on underlying EBITDA, reflecting currency devaluations, mainly the Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha, partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc and Ugandan shilling.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Tax</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The effective tax rate was 39.1% compared to 49.7% in the prior period, largely a result of profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 33%, largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and higher withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Exceptional items</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An exceptional gain of $4m was recorded in the quarter ended 30 June 2021 in respect of a profit on the sale of towers in Rwanda. The exceptional gain of $7m in the prior period related to a deferred tax credit recognition in Tanzania.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>EPS before exceptional items</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>EPS before exceptional items for the quarter was 3.2 cents, up from 1.0 cent in the prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset the increased tax charges from higher profits. Net finance cost and minority interest were broadly stable.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Operating free cash flow</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Operating free cash flow was $428m, up 38.7% on the prior period, due to higher underlying EBITDA more than offsetting increased capital expenditure. Prior period capital expenditure was lower due to logistical challenges faced during the pandemic.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Leverage</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Leverage (net debt to underlying EBITDA) improved year on year, to 1.8x at 30 June 2021 from 2.2x at 30 June 2020, despite investing $247m of intangible capex to renew licences in two of our largest markets, Nigeria and Uganda, and acquiring additional spectrum across a few of our markets. The increase in underlying EBITDA more than offset the increase in net debt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n</span></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Other significant updates</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sale of towers in Tanzania</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In June 2021, Airtel Africa signed a deal for the sale of the tower portfolio belonging to Airtel Tanzania to a joint venture company owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of SBA Communications Corporation, a leading global independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, as majority owner, and by Paradigm Infrastructure Limited, a UK company focused on developing, owning and operating shared passive wireless infrastructure in selected growth markets.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The tower portfolio in Airtel Tanzania comprises approximately 1,400 towers which form part of the Group's wireless telecommunications infrastructure network. Under the terms of the transaction, the Group's subsidiary, Airtel Tanzania plc, will continue to develop, maintain and operate its equipment on the towers under a separate lease arrangement with the purchaser.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The consideration for the transaction is approximately $175m of which approximately $157.5m is payable on the first closing date (expected to take place in the second half of the Group's current financial year), with the balance payable in instalments upon the completion of the transfer of any remaining towers to the purchaser. Around $60m from the proceeds will be used to invest in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania and for distribution to the Government of Tanzania, as per the settlement described in the Airtel Africa IPO Prospectus document published in June 2019. The balance of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt at Group level.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>New SIM registration rules in Nigeria</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As previously highlighted, following a directive issued by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on 7 December 2020 to all Nigerian telecom operators, Airtel Nigeria has been working with the government to ensure that all our subscribers provide their valid National Identification Numbers (NINs) to update SIM registration records.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Initially, new customer acquisitions were barred until significant progress had been made on linking the active customer base with verified NINs. Natural churn in the customer base led to a loss of 2.0 million active mobile customers in Nigeria in the first quarter of the year (following on from 2.5 million customer loss in the final quarter of the year to 31 March 2021), however, the financial impact has been minimal, with continued revenue growth, due largely to the significantly lower ARPU of the churned base and increased usage by the active base. In April, the NCC announced that it would allow new customer enrolment to recommence from certified outlets (a branch or kiosk where customers can sign up to Airtel). Airtel Nigeria has so far received approvals for over 2,100 outlets and new customer registrations have recommenced in those outlets accordingly. The NCC also issued a further directive in April with the effect that no individual customers can register more than four SIM cards under one NIN on any network.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The original regulatory directive set an initial deadline for customers to register their NIN with their SIM of 30 December 2020. This was subsequently moved several times with the latest deadline set for 31 October 2021.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>We have made significant progress on capturing existing NINs and building the database in collaboration with National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). To date, out of Airtel Nigeria's 40.9 million active customers, we have collated NIN information for over 25.0 million active mobile customers. To complete the registration process, we must also verify the NIN information we have received from our subscribers with the NIMC.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For the still significant proportion of the population, and our customers, that do not have a NIN we have opened enrolment centres in collaboration with the NIMC and we are in the process of rolling out thousands of devices to further NIN enrolment. We continue to work closely with the government to ensure full compliance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Refinancing</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In April 2021, Airtel Africa agreed a new $500m loan facility with a group of relationship banks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The new committed facility consists of a combination of a revolving credit facility and term loans with tenor of up to 4 years. The facility was used to partially refinance the Group's \u20ac750m euro denominated bond due 20 May 2021. The balance of the euro denominated bond was repaid with existing Group cash to reduce gross debt and associated interest costs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The new loan facility further strengthens the core liquidity of the Group. It also has prepayment flexibilities that allow the Group to optimise the efficiency of its capital structure with the free cash flows and cash receipts anticipated over the next 12 months following the recent announcements related to tower sales and mobile money minority investments.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>New shareholding requirements in Kenya</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On 9 April 2021, the Minister for ICT published an amendment to the National Information Communications and Technology (ICT) Policy Guidelines, 2020 (ICT Policy). The ICT Policy amendment will affect Airtel Africa's Kenya business as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Airtel Networks Kenya Limited, which currently holds an indefinite exemption from the Minister for ICT, dated 20 March 2013, has three years with effect from 9 April 2021 to comply with the requirement to have a 30% local shareholding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Airtel Money Kenya Limited, which holds a Content Service Provider Licence from the Communications Authority of Kenya, with effect from November 2020, has three years from the date of the licence to comply with the requirement to have a 30% local shareholding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Under the amended ICT policy, a licensee may apply to the ICT Minister for an extension of time to comply with the requirement, or to obtain an exemption.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Appointment of new CEO, and other senior executive changes</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On 29 April 2021, Airtel Africa announced that Olusegun \"Segun\" Ogunsanya, managing director and chief executive officer Airtel Nigeria is to succeed Raghunath \"Raghu\" Mandava, as managing director and chief executive officer following Raghu Mandava's informing the Board of his intention to retire. Segun Ogunsanya will join the Board of Airtel Africa plc with effect from 1 October 2021.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Segun Ogunsanya joined Airtel Africa in 2012 as managing director and chief executive officer Airtel Nigeria and has been responsible for the overall management of our operations in Nigeria, our largest market in Africa. Segun has more than 25 years' business management experience in banking, consumer goods and telecoms. Before joining Airtel in 2012, Segun held leadership roles at Coca-Cola in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya (as managing director and chief executive officer). He has also been the managing director of Nigerian Bottling Company Ltd (Coca-Cola Hellenic owned) and Group head of retail banking operations at Ecobank Transnational Inc, covering 28 countries in Africa. He is an electronics engineer and also a chartered accountant.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Raghu Mandava will be retiring as managing director and chief executive officer, as a director of Airtel Africa plc and as a member of the Market Disclosure Committee on 30 September 2021. Arrangements have been made to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. Following his cessation of employment at Airtel Africa, Mr. Mandava will be available to advise the Chairman, the Airtel Africa Board and the newly appointed managing director and chief executive officer for a 9-month period.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jaideep Paul, chief financial officer, was appointed as an executive director and joined the Board of Airtel Africa plc with effect from 1 June 2021.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\n<span>Information on additional KPIs</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An investor relations pack with information on the additional KPIs and balance

The customer base decline of 1.6 million from the prior period, and 1.1 million in the quarter, was due to the implementation of the new \"Know-Your-Customer\" (KYC) requirements in Nigeria which had included a temporary halt to new customer activations.

The customer base growth was driven by expansion of our 4G network, with 87.3% of total sites now on 4G, and an increase in smartphone penetration. Data customer penetration increased by 2.7 percentage points to 43.5% compared with previous period. Data revenue accounted for 38.5% of total revenue in the quarter, up 2.7 percentage points from 35.7% in the prior period.

The data customer base as a proportion of total customers reached 35.1%, an increase of 2 percentage points. The data ARPU growth of 18.5% was driven largely by the increase in data consumption per customer, up 26.7% to 3.2 GB per month (from 2.5 GB per month).

The 4G data customer base now contributes 37.9% to the total data customer base, with a total data usage contribution from 4G of 63.6%, up from 51.2% in previous period.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Data revenue contribution reached 32.1% of total Group revenue in the quarter, up from 31.1% in the prior period.</span>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mobile money</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Description</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Unit of</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>measure</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">\n<p>\n<span>Quarter ended</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>June-21</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>June-20</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Reported currency change %</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Constant currency change %</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Summarised statement of operations</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Revenue <span>1</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>124</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>81</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>52.8%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>53.7%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Underlying EBITDA</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>60</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>39</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>53.5%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>53.3%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Underlying EBITDA margin</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>48.8%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>48.5%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>24 bps</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>(12) bps</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Depreciation and amortisation</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>(3)</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>(3)</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>0.2%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>(1.2%)</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Operating profit</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>57</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>36</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>57.9%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>57.6%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Capex</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>3</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>2</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>85.4%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>85.4%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Operating free cash flow</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>57</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>37</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>52.4%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>51.2%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Operating KPIs</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Mobile money key KPIs</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Transaction value</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$m</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>14,651</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>9,007</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>62.7%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>64.4%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Active customers</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>million</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>23.1</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>18.5</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>24.6%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Mobile money ARPU</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>$</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>1.8</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>1.5</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>24.7%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>25.4%</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span>(1)</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>Mobile money service revenue</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>post inter-segment eliminations with mobile services was $96m in the quarter ended 30 June 2021 and $55m in the quarter ended 30 June 2020.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Mobile money revenue grew by 52.8% to $124m in reported currency. In constant currency mobile money revenue grew 53.7%. Revenue growth for the quarter partially benefitted from a weakened comparative in the first quarter of the prior year due to Covid-19 restrictions and waiver of charges on certain transactions in a few markets to support those economies</span>\n<span>. Even after adjusting for these effects, the revenue growth rate was ahead of the Q4'21 trend.</span>\n<span>The Q1'22 constant currency revenue growth of 53.7% was driven by 24.6% growth of the customer base and 25.4% growth in ARPU, led by transaction value per customer growth of 34.2%. The customer base growth was largely driven by expansion of our distribution network, as we continued to invest in exclusive kiosks and mobile money branches. The expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, through partnerships with leading financial institutions, and the expansion of our merchant ecosystem further strengthened our mobile money propositions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Underlying EBITDA for mobile money grew by 53.5% to $60m in reported currency. In constant currency, underlying EBITDA grew by 53.3%. Underlying EBITDA margin was 48.8%, an improvement of 24 basis points in reported currency, while in constant currency the underlying EBITDA margin dropped by 12 basis points. The total transaction value grew by 64.4% in constant currency, driven by customer base growth and growth in the transaction value per customer per month of 34.2% (to $217 per month in Q1'22). The Q1'22 annualised transaction value reached $58.3bn in constant currency, with mobile money revenue contributing 11.1% of total revenue in the quarter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The mobile money customer base reached 23.1 million at 30 June 2021, up 24.6% from the prior period, with 19.1% of our total customer base now Airtel Money customers, an increase of 2.5 percentage points. Mobile money ARPU grew by 25.4%, driven by the increase in transaction values and a higher contribution from merchant payments, cash transactions, P2P transfers and mobile services recharges through Airtel Money.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Forward looking statements</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This document contains certain forward-looking statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and markets in which the Group operates.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"positioned,\" \"strategy,\" \"outlook\", \"target\" and similar expressions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It is believed that the expectations reflected in this document are reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range of variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual future financial condition, performance and results to differ materially from the plans, goals, expectations and results expressed in the forward-looking statements and other financial and/or statistical data within this communication.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are uncertainties related to the following: the impact of competition from illicit trade; the impact of adverse domestic or international legislation and regulation; changes in domestic or international tax laws and rates; adverse litigation and dispute outcomes and the effect of such outcomes on Airtel Africa's financial condition; changes or differences in domestic or international economic or political conditions; the ability to obtain price increases and the impact of price increases on consumer affordability thresholds; adverse decisions by domestic or international regulatory bodies; the impact of market size reduction and consumer down-trading; translational and transactional foreign exchange rate exposure; the impact of serious injury, illness or death in the workplace; the ability to maintain credit ratings; the ability to develop, produce or market new alternative products and to do so profitably; the ability to effectively implement strategic initiatives and actions taken to increase sales growth; the ability to enhance cash generation and pay dividends and changes in the market position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Airtel Africa.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser.

Growth metrics are provided on a constant currency basis unless otherwise stated. The Group has presented certain financial information on a constant currency basis. This is calculated by translating the results for the current financial year and prior financial year at a fixed 'constant currency' exchange rate, which is done to measure the organic performance of the Group.

In determining the percentage change in constant currency terms, both current and previous financial reporting period's results have been converted using exchange rates prevailing as on 31 March 2021. Reported currency percentage change is derived on the basis of average actual periodic exchange rates for that financial period.

Hence, underlying revenue has not been defined as an APM for this quarter. No deferred tax has been recorded under exceptional tax item for the quarter ended 30 June 2021. Hence adjusted effective tax rate has similarly not been defined as an APM for this quarter. Finally, the dividend is no longer linked with free cash flow. Hence, free cash flow is no longer defined as an APM.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Glossary</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Technical and Industry Terms</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>4G data customer</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A customer having a 4G handset and who has used at least 1MB on any of the Group's GPRS, 3G &amp; 4G network in the last 30 days.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Airtel Money (mobile money)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Airtel Money is the brand name for Airtel Africa's mobile money products and services.
