At  the time, the Shenzhen-listed company already received nearly 1.4 billion yuan from the sale of Patozon.</p><p>The trading firm's lawsuit shows there may be more signs of trouble in the \"made in China, sold on Amazon\" community following the US e-commerce giant's extensive crackdown that has seen the removal of thousands of Chinese sellers from the platform.</p><p>A total of 615 million yuan from the Patozon sale remains unpaid, according to Global  Top's filing on Wednesday. That includes 326 million yuan from investment firms representing Patozon's founders and senior management team, as well as  236 million yuan from Achiever Ventures III (Hong Kong), which wanted to pull out of the deal.</p><p>Achiever Ventures requested to terminate its deal because of \"a material adverse change\" in the business of Patozon, according to Global Top.</p><p>It said legal action against  the Hong Kong firm would be considered if the two sides failed to reach an agreement.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, said in January that the \"made in China, sold on Amazon\" community continued to grow in 2021 despite its crackdown on paid reviews and other violations.</p><p>However, a report in the same month by business intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse showed Chinese merchants made up  33 per cent of Amazon's top  sellers by the end of 2021, down from 40 per cent at the start of  the year.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2022 South China Morning Post.
