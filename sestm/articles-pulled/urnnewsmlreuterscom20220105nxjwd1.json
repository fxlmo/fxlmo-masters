The deal with Reliance is crucial to Future Group, which is on the brink of liquidation. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Amazon tried to block the deal by getting a freeze order from Singapore arbitration court. Future Group\u2019s prospective sell out to Reliance threatens the U.S. company\u2019s dominance in India.<br/><br/>A single-judge bench of Justice Amit Bansal had, yesterday, dismissed Future Group\u2019s petition, refusing to interfere in the arbitration proceedings at the Singapore court. Future Group today urged the Delhi High Court to urgently hear an appeal against that order. <br/><br/>Future Group sought the court to terminate the proceedings in Singapore tribunal after the Competition Commission of India (CCI), last month, kept its approval for the 2019 deal on hold, accusing the U.S. e-commerce company of hiding information while seeking regulatory approval. The suspension of CCI approval clears way for Future\u2019s merger with Reliance. <br/><br/>Future Group urged the Singapore court to terminate proceedings after the CCI order suspended the 2019 deal. The tribunal agreed to hear Future Group\u2019s plea only after the main hearing in the arbitration case between Jan. 5 and 7, following which the Indian company approached the Delhi High Court.<br/>   - By Ujjwal Narayan and Siddhi Nayak; Ujjwal.Narayan@newsrise.org; 01166767700<br/>- Edited by Dhanya Ann Thoppil<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
