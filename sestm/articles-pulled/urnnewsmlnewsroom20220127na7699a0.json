In the quarter we saw good performance from SaniSure, which is capitalising on a robust bioprocessing market, WilsonHCG which delivered good performance driven by continued strength of the US labour market and BoConcept, which continues to see strong demand despite restrictions remaining in some of its key markets. Other notable contributions to our return include WP and AES.
