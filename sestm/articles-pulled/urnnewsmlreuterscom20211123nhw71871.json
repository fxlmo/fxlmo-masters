Though Sony's latest high-tech console remains more elusive than the Loch Ness monster at the bar with Bigfoot, shoppers are still looking for savings on games and accessories for that model and its elder model, the PlayStation 4. Fortunately, great deals on easy-to-use accessories and top-rated video games aren't hard to find before Black Friday.\u00a0</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p><span><span>Tackle your holiday shopping with deals and expert advice delivered straight to your phone.</span> Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting team at Reviewed.</span> </p><p>The likes of Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop\u00a0and more feature numerous discounts on titles and trinkets compatible with the PS4 and PS5. While both consoles are tough to find at the moment (let alone on sale), there are still early Black Friday deals on controllers, headsets and even access to Sony's game subscription service to scoop up today.</p><p>For instance, you can get the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset at Amazon for as low as $79. Normally priced at $99.99, these wired headphones are on sale for 21% off. We named the Cloud II as the best affordable gaming headset for its\u00a0strong and durable aluminum body that also supported\u00a0very comfortable ear cups. Our tester also called them \"explosively loud\" and clear enough to hear surprising new sound effects deep into a session of\u00a0 <span>Overwatch</span> .\u00a0</p><p>There's a lot more to pick from while searching for savings online and we found the best of the best.
