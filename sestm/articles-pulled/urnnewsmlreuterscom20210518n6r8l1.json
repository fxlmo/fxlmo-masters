Bharti's 4Q ARPU down 13% on-quarter to INR145 and down 1% excluding impact of Interconnect Usage Charges, house notes. \u201cWe find this surprising considering Bharti's improving subscriber mix and front-ended subscriber additions in 4Q,\u201d house says. Lowers ARPU estimates by 4-5% to factor 4Q miss. Cuts India mobile estimates, but raises consolidated estimates by 1-3% to factor in increase in Home broadband, Airtel Business and Airtel Africa segments. Increases subscriber forecasts by 4% after 4Q positive surprise of 13.4 million subscriber additions and expects 13% CAGR in revenues and 18% CAGR in EBITDA. Still, maintains Hold rating and INR590 target price, citing limited upside triggers.
