Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, Justice A S Bopanna and Justice Hima Kohli heard the case.</p><p>Meanwhile, the high court has listed the hearing of four cases in the legal battle between Future Group and e-commerce major Amazon on February 24. The court will hear Future Retail\u0092s plea, along with four other cases.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>The four are the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\u0092s (SIAC\u0092s) emergency award, which stalled Future Group\u0092s deal with Reliance Retail, and the SIAC\u0092s tribunal order, which upheld the emergency award.</p><p>There is also Amazon\u0092s case of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) issuing summons to it on violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act while investing in Future Coupons in 2019. Also Amazon had challenged the high court\u0092s observations in its order in December 2020.</p><p>\u0093The direction of the Supreme Court to send the matter to the high court is based on the reasoning that principles of natural justice were not adhered to when the order was passed. Both parties will have to be heard and new orders are required to be passed after giving a proper opportunity of hearing. But the high court is free to decide the case on its own merit after considering the evidence and the legal principles,\u0094 said Ashish K Singh, managing partner, Capstone Legal.</p><p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on February 25 will hear Amazon\u0092s plea seeking an interim stay on the order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which suspended the more than two-year-old approval of its deal with Future Coupons (FCPL).</p><p>The legal battle between Future Group and Amazon started in October 2020 after the former decided to sell its retail, logistics, and warehousing businesses to Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. The move by Amazon comes because in August 2019, the US e-commerce major acquired a 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons, the promoter entity of Future Retail, for about ~1,500 crore.</p><p>After the Future-Reliance deal, Amazon approached the SIAC in October 2020 and an emergency arbitration interim order was passed, upholding the position of Amazon. The order directed the Future Group entities not to proceed with the transactions with Reliance Retail.</p><p>In November 2020, Future Group challenged the SIAC\u0092s interim order at the Delhi High Court and in February 2021, a single-judge Bench order upheld the SIAC\u0092s interim order. Future Group then filed an appeal at the Delhi High Court before a Divisional Bench, challenging the single-judge Bench order. The Divisional Bench stayed the single-judge Bench\u0092s order.</p><p>In February 2021, Amazon moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Divisional Bench order, and Future Group moved the NCLT Mumbai to seek approvals to go ahead with its deal with Reliance Retail.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
