AVEVA will help drive EDF\u2019s SWITCH digital transformation program with its AVEVA\u2122 E3D Design solution and other components of the AVEVA <sup>TM</sup> Unified Engineering solution.\u00a0 EDF will strengthen its engineering design portfolio by way of faster design and delivery of its nuclear plants as well as advanced safety and performance standards.</p>\n<p>By streamlining data from different design disciplines \u2013 including mechanical, electrical and civil works \u2013 several hundred users across different global locations will be able to work together within a digital twin repository, eliminating siloed engineering design approaches, avoiding data inconsistencies, and removing duplication. AVEVA technology will enable users to collaborate on shared 3D models simultaneously, thus improving the competitiveness of EDF\u2019s nuclear engineering design processes.</p>\n<p>This partnership builds on a long-term relationship between AVEVA and EDF. AVEVA has supported EDF with 3D digital engineering solutions at its N4 nuclear plants since the 1980s. To date, AVEVA\u2019s capabilities have enabled EDF to drive its sustainable nuclear vision by reducing operational work-hours and by enhancing data consistency.</p>\n<p>The new partnership between AVEVA and EDF is expected to generate the following results:</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Reduction in design work times and in engineering work times.</li>\n<li>Decrease in the need for re-work due to consistently accurate and high-quality deliverables.</li>\n<li>Faster development rate of 3D models.</li>\n<li>Greater project visibility for all project stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Greater collaboration between design and engineering teams.</li>\n<li>Extended asset lifespans and the ability to reduce CO\u2082 emissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new agreement will see AVEVA digital design systems implemented as the gold standard for all new EDF nuclear projects.</p>\n<p>EDF Group Executive Director \u2013 Engineering and New Nuclear Project, Xavier Ursat commented, \u201cThe SWITCH digital transformation program is critical to reinforce EDF\u2019s ambition of producing low-carbon electricity and achieving our carbon neutrality objective by 2050 across our portfolio. AVEVA has been a trusted partner for EDF for more than 30 years, helping us to accomplish our digital transformation. AVEVA understands our requirements and we trust them to enable us to accelerate our clean energy goals. This extended long-term partnership supports our engineering design and operations teams and empowers them to optimize operational performance and to exploit nuclear energy efficiently.\u201d</p>\n<p>AVEVA CEO Peter Herweck said, \u201cWe are proud to have built a trusted partnership with EDF that serves as the foundation stone of its digital transformation vision and sustainability program. Our market-leading digital engineering design enables us to support EDF in driving their net-zero energy strategy for the benefit of end consumers throughout the world. With our new agreement, AVEVA will help EDF accelerate engineering collaboration, connect teams and unlock higher performance through shared contextual data and intelligence. We look forward to assisting EDF\u2019s expert engineers to cut design time, improve collaboration and accelerate efficient decision-making to develop the nuclear industry of the future.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>About AVEVA</strong></p>\n<p>AVEVA is a global leader in industrial software, driving digital transformation and sustainability.
