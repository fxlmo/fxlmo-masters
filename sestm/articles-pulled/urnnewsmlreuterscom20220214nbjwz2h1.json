I planned a vacation to Mexico, and I brought an Echo device along for the trip. I actually went out and bought the device just before the trip, and I remember Danielle even asking me why we needed another one.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>At home, we use Alexa on a daily basis, and part of our routine is listening to our morning flash briefing. Sneakily, I had built a <span><a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/flashbriefing/steps-to-create-a-flash-briefing-skill.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">flash briefing skill</a></span>that linked to a blog post I wrote.

It started off like a regular flash briefing-but it started getting specific. I was trying to play it cool, and we were both sort of just looking at our phones, listening to Alexa in the background. However, as Alexa kept speaking, it started to recount our history as a couple, playing music that was special to us, and telling inside jokes. It took Danielle a few minutes, but she soon realized what was happening.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>She was so excited-she quickly said yes, and then she immediately asked Alexa to start the flash briefing over again. She'd only been half paying attention, expecting her usual flash briefing, so of course we needed to hear it again!</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>Having Echo as my wingman, Danielle didn't hesitate to say yes.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <h4>\n          The wedding\n        </h4>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>When our wedding came around, it only made sense for Alexa to be a part of it.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>We were brainstorming ways that Alexa could be a part of our special day. Eventually, we decided that the best place for Alexa on our wedding day was as our cake topper. We did a buffet of desserts, and standing in the middle of it all were two Echo devices we'd bought just for the occasion.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>When the wedding was over, we gifted those two Echo devices to our best man and maid of honor, as a thank you for standing with us on the big day.</span>\n                  </p>\n                  <h4>\n          The happily ever after\n        </h4>\n                  <p>\n                    <span>We have several Echo devices and <span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/alexa-smart-home/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21442899011&amp;ref=_alxhb_tpnv_smhm\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">supporting smart devices</a></span>, like lights and Fire TV, all around our home.
