The news comes as the Firm has finalized its acquisition of a 51% stake in the Arab Investment Bank (aiBANK), marking a strategic entry into the fast-growing and solid Egyptian commercial banking sector. The transaction will see EFG Hermes Holding assume control of aiBANK, with TSFE Financial Services &amp; Fintech Subfund, a subfund fully owned by the Sovereign Fund of Egypt, EFG Hermes Holding's valued partner, acquiring a 25% stake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"The closing of this landmark transaction with our esteemed partner TSFE will drive the transformation of our Egyptian operations into a universal bank with an investment bank, a commercial bank and a fast-growing Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) platform, ensuring that we can provide a holistic set of financial products and services to both retail and corporate clients alike in our home market. In Egypt and across a dozen other frontier emerging markets, we continue to be the region's premier investment bank franchise with market leading shares of trading across most of our markets and active roles in a number of recent regional transactions like the IPO of ACWA <span> Power on Tadawul and Fertiglobe on ADX among many others,\" said <span>EFG Hermes Holding's Group CEO Karim Awad.</span>\n</span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"The completion of the acquisition of a majority stake in aiBANK should be looked at as another step towards building a business model that can withstand the cyclicality of capital markets and increase synergies creation potential across the platform,\" Awad added. \"Our efforts to geographically diversify our business means that we are now present in 13 countries with the ability to offer financial services to more than 1 billion people living and doing business in some of the world's fastest-growing markets. The addition of a commercial bank in our home market also means that EFG Hermes Holding (through its different subsidiaries and brands) can provide its Egyptian clients with a single destination for all their financial services,\" concluded Awad.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Over the past few years, EFG Hermes Holding has transformed itself from a pure play MENA investment bank into an Egyptian universal bank with a market-leading frontier emerging markets (FEM) investment banking platform that is home to super brands. Today, we can offer our corporate, retail and institutional clients across all our jurisdictions best-in-class sell-side services (securities brokerage, advisory and research) in addition to a multitude of investment solutions that include world-class management of funds that invest in renewables (Vortex Energy), MENA and frontier public equities (EFG Hermes and FIM), Education (Egypt Education Fund) and startups (EFG EV Fintech).

Drawing on our proven track-record and a team of more than 6,000 talented employees, we provide a wide spectrum of financial services that include investment banking, asset management, securities brokerage, research, and private equity to the entire MENA region.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In 2015, EFG Hermes Holding launched its Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) Platform, which overlooks activities in the Non-Banking Finance field covering microfinance, leasing, factoring, Buy-Now Pay-Later (BNPL), mortgage and insurance. This falls in line with the Firm's strategy to focus on two main pillars: product diversification and geographic expansion into non-MENA markets, which has seen the Firm establish a physical presence in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Kenya, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</span>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Learn more about us at</span>\n<span>\n<span>www.efghermes.com</span>\n</span>\n<span>&amp; stay connected with us.\u202f\u202f\u202f</span>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Note on Forward-Looking Statements</span>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In this press release, EFG Hermes Holding may make forward looking statements, including, for example, statements about management's expectations, strategic objectives, growth opportunities and business prospects.
