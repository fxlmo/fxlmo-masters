Elie is a Canadian citizen and holds a BEng in Telecommunications and an EMBA.<span class=\"au\"> \u00a0</span>We believe he will drive forward Tampnet in helping its customers in their digitalisation journey, increasing efficiency and identifying new revenue streams.</p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">We also saw good performance from Valorem and the projects portfolio, while there was completion of a further divestment from the India Fund at an uplift to carrying value.</p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"az\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"az\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"az\">Portfolio returns</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"a\">The portfolio is delivering a good level of income.
