Customers who use Alteryx on AWS can prepare, investigate and model data faster and automate complex analysis with a single user experience, thanks to the unified self-service analytics platform running in a simple and scalable data environment. As a result, analysts and citizen data scientists alike can uncover business insights at scale, regardless of coding ability.</p>\n<p>Alteryx customer Talent Plus, an internationally recognized talent consulting firm with more than 400 clients in 30 countries, needed a tool that would address the growing list of technology issues they felt were blocking speedy, effective access to company data. They quickly wove Alteryx into day-to-day data integration and blending requests and were impressed with the ease and speed with which traditional tasks could be done. Alteryx enabled them to fully create a flexible data warehouse with Amazon Redshift that could accept intricate data from the legacy system with increased build speed during initial construction, affirming how Alteryx enables fast, seamless Amazon Redshift performance. With this deployment, Talent Plus created a robust data warehouse that drastically cut down the time necessary for basic data requests, enabling them to become more self-sufficient by running their own analytic queries, all while fostering a culture of innovation throughout multiple departments at the company.</p>\n<p>As an Advanced Technology Partner in the AWS Partner Network (APN), Alteryx offers easy access to data and analytics across cloud, on-prem and hybrid sources, including seamless integration with Athena, Redshift and Aurora. This gives customers an easy way to access and analyze all of their data and to drive faster business outcomes through analytic automation. Now more than 310,000 active AWS Marketplace customers can purchase Alteryx Designer and Alteryx Server under a consolidated spend as a single bill from AWS. Customers are also now able to get the value of Alteryx as part of their AWS enterprise discount program (EDP).</p>\n<p>Alteryx solutions in AWS Marketplace: <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3360369-1&amp;h=2815150049&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fpp%2Fprodview-h6znkixubjike&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fpp%2Fprodview-h6znkixubjike\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-h6znkixubjike</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To learn more about Alteryx and AWS, please visit: <u><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3360369-1&amp;h=2760887898&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alteryx.com%2Fpartners%2Famazon-web-services&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alteryx.com%2Fpartners%2Famazon-web-services\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.alteryx.com/partners/amazon-web-services</a></u></p>\n<p>Download the AWS Starter Kit at: <u><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3360369-1&amp;h=315103395&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alteryx.com%2Fstarter-kit%2Faws&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alteryx.com%2Fstarter-kit%2Faws\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.alteryx.com/starter-kit/aws</a></u>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>About Alteryx<br/></b>Alteryx, the Analytics Automation company, is focused on enabling every person to transform data into a breakthrough.
