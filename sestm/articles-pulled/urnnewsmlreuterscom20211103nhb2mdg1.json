Flex drivers are independent contractors who can download an app that will allow them to select different orders they want to deliver, and they\u00a0need a personal vehicle like a 4-door, mid-sized sedan or larger vehicle, such as a truck, to make the deliveries.\u00a0</p><p>Flex drivers deliver goods and groceries ordered through Amazon Prime Now and AmazonFresh programs, according to the FTC. These allow for customers to tip their drivers.</p><p>Affected drivers should deposit or cash their checks before Jan. 7.</p><p><span><span>Follow Keira Wingate on Twitter: @KeiraRenee</span> </span> </p><p><span>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: More than 140,000 Amazon drivers to be repaid nearly $60 million in alleged withheld tips</span> </p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2021 GANNETT</p></div>"}
