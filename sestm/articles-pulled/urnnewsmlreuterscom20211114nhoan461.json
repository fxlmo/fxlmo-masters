Ltd (FCPL), for a 49% stake by making \"deliberate misrepresentations\" and \"actively misleading\" the antitrust watchdog.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Citing Amazon's internal communications, the directors alleged that representations made by Amazon to CCI were \"contradictory\" to such correspondences, according to the letter submitted by the FRL independent directors to CCI that was uploaded on the exchanges on Sunday.</p><p>Amazon and the debt-laden Future Group are locked in a legal battle over the latter's sale of its retail and wholesale assets to Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL's) retail unit for Rs.24,713 crore. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) had dealt a blow to the cash-strapped Future Group by halting the deal.</p><p>On the allegations about misrepresentation to CCI, the arbitration tribunal in its October 20 order said: \"Significant emphasis has also been placed by FRL on various filings made by Amazon before CCI, particularly two responses filed by Amazon on November 15, 2019. FRL contends that Amazon's assertion that the agreements constitute a single integrated transaction under which Amazon obtained negative, protective, special and material rights in FRL stands unequivocally contradicted by its own submissions to CCI.\"</p><p>In the tribunal's view, the proceedings before CCI were concerned with public policy issues, particularly whether or not the transaction would cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India. SIAC found that Amazon disclosed to CCI that the proposed combination (Amazon-FCPL deal) also included FRL and had also disclosed all the agreements to CCI.</p><p>Negative, protective, special and material rights that would accrue to Amazon were disclosed as well to CCI, SIAC said.</p><p>\"In the circumstances, the tribunal finds Amazon had not hidden its interest in FRL in its submissions to CCI. Amazon had disclosed that the retail assets of FRL are an integral part of the valuation of FRL's shares. Any negative effect on the same due to the alienation of the same, therefore, will indirectly affect the value of Amazon's investment in FCPL,\" SIAC said.</p><p>What Amazon has acquired in the present case are negative and protective rights, SIAC said. They do not amount to control, the tribunal added. Power by which an acquirer can only prevent a company from doing what the latter wants to do is by itself, not control, it said. In SIAC's view, the rights Amazon has acquired do not put it in the metaphorical driving seat.</p><p>When asked about SIAC's rulings, a Future Group spokesman said the purported facts are grossly untrue.</p><p>An internal email from Rakesh Bakshi, head, legal, and assistant general counsel, Amazon India, to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos reveals in detail how Amazon viewed and planned to enforce its agreements, the spokesman said.</p><p>\"The documents lay bare how Amazon intended to circumvent Indian laws that restrict it from having any right in retail entities in India through a 'twin-entity structure'. It also shows how for $41 million (approximately Rs.280 crore), as detailed by its own calculations, Amazon is holding ransom a Rs.24,500 crore Future Group-Reliance transaction that can bring relief to banks, lenders, operational creditors and employees of Future Group,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>The internal communication also said the number of equity shares of FRL to be held by FCPL is such that Amazon can indirectly hold the same number of shares of Future Retail that it would have acquired if it had directly invested Rs.1,400 crore in Future Retail at a price per share, representing a 25% premium on the minimum regulatory price prescribed for issuance of fresh shares of a listed entity under Indian law.</p><p>Amazon is paying a premium of 25% or Rs.280 crore over the regulatory price of the securities of Future Retail, it said.</p><p>The letter by the independent directors states that Amazon was to invest directly in FRL through the FPI route. However, restrictions arising out of the 2018 Press Note 2 notification led to a change in the investment structure, with Amazon investing in a twin-entity investment structure. Amazon thus invested in FCPL, with FCPL acquiring 9.82% of FRL. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
