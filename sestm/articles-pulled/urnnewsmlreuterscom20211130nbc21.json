(AWS) Partner Network (APN) and AWS Storage Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Competency Partner, today announced extended protection against ransomware with support for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Object Lock. Amazon S3 Object Lock provides a write-once-read-many (WORM) model for data in S3 to help further secure customers against ransomware and to prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for the duration of a customer-defined retention period. Rubrik customers can now utilize Rubrik Zero Trust Data Security with Amazon S3 as an immutable archive, ensuring long term backups are kept on a reliable storage service to quickly recover from ransomware attacks.<br/></p><p>While ransomware attacks are on the rise, Rubrik continues to experience significant interest for its Zero Trust Data Security solutions following its recently announced $5 million Ransomware Recovery Warranty. This offering is a warranty that reassures customers they will be able to recover from cyber attacks and operational failures by using Rubrik\u2019s Enterprise Edition offering.</p><p>\u201cThe combination of immutable backups from Rubrik and immutable object storage from Amazon S3 gives customers a strong foundation for protecting against a range of threats to the integrity of their backup data,\u201d said Paul Meighan, Senior Manager, Product Management for Amazon S3 at AWS. \u201cS3\u2019s industry leading durability, availability, performance, and security make it ideal for keeping backups safe and secure. Rubrik\u2019s integration with S3 Object Lock adds additional protection against both accidental and malicious deletes, which we think will make a big difference for customers.\u201d</p><p>\"We live in an era where no business has the luxury of thinking of ransomware protection as an afterthought,\u201d said Brian Chutro, IT Manager at Pampered Chef. \u201cGiven the sophistication and pervasiveness of cyberattacks today, IT leaders need to be proactive and strategic in their data security and cloud decisions to help keep their businesses safe. That's why Rubrik's new support for Amazon S3 Object Lock is so critical and helps further protect companies against ransomware. Working with companies like AWS and Rubrik help provide the peace of mind IT teams are seeking.\"</p><p>The global pandemic and increasing hybrid work models have driven even more demand for Rubrik and AWS, specifically across manufacturing, media, and state, local, and education (SLED) / public sector verticals. Rubrik\u2019s data security platform continues to be a solution that delivers protection for customers\u2019 hybrid cloud data estates.
