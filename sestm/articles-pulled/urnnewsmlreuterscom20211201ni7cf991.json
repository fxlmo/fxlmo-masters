Naming AWS as our preferred Cloud provider helps us to even further accelerate how we innovate and deliver even more personalised and scalable services for our customers and employees.\"In April, it was announced that San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and United Airlines will test SITA's Smart Path biometric solution.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
