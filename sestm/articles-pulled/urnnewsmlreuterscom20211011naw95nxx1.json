Together with its strategic partner, Schneider Electric, AVEVA will demonstrate its AVEVA\u2122 Unified Operations Center for Smart Cities,\u00a0which seamlessly integrates systems, sites, people and assets for cities of the future, at the Middle East\u2019s largest technology exhibition.</p>\n<p>With increasing urbanization, mounting cost pressures, and demand for improved quality of life, there is now a global move towards infrastructure consolidation, upgrade, and continuous improvement of cities. AVEVA\u2019s Unified Operations Center for Smart Cities drives streamlined operational efficiency and reduced energy costs, while promoting adherence to cybersecurity, safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur Unified Operations Center is the command-and-control solution for infrastructure and smart city operators based on an integrative \u2018System of Systems\u2019 approach. It can be used to collate information from various data sources to anticipate and resolve problems even before they are presented, coordinate various resources and processes for seamless operation, and generally make more strategic decisions. It converges OT and IT technology into a single pane-of-glass solution, where the operator can effectively monitor and control entire city operations through a \u2018City in a Box\u2019 approach as we like to call it,\u201d says Dr Tariq Aslam, Head of MEA, AVEVA.</p>\n<p>AVEVA\u2019s Unified Operations Center for Smart Cities and Schneider Electric\u2019s IoT-enabled sustainability platform \u2013 EcoStruxure Resource Advisor offer smart city operators a powerful solution. The EcoStruxure Resource Advisor is a best-in-class, AI-assisted, cloud-based solution for managing cross-enterprise energy and sustainability data, which shows how operators can track data across more than 400 categories to have near real-time access to their resource performance.</p>\n<p>EcoStruxure is powered by Microsoft Azure enabling integration and interoperability to turn data into meaningful insights. The data is paired with Schneider\u2019s unique approach to energy and sustainability consulting, bringing together technology and expertise, resulting in a \u201cmind-plus-machine\u201d approach to climate action.</p>\n<p>\u201cAVEVA, Schneider Electric and Microsoft are accelerating the delivery of smart city innovation across regions. Our unique combination of capabilities helps municipalities capitalize on the power of technology to become more agile, resilient, and sustainable. We plan to demonstrate smart cities in action on our Unified Operations Center with our strategic partners, Schneider Electric and Microsoft on their stands,\u201d Dr Aslam adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be showcasing the AVEVA Unified Operations Center for Smart Cities, to demonstrate how technologies such as AI and big data can transform how an urban environment is run to make it more efficient, greener, and better for the public and businesses,\u201d says Ayman Ismail, Industry and Business Development VP, Schneider Electric Gulf Countries. \u201cDigitization and digital technologies will make our cities more efficient and more sustainable, and we must prioritize technology developments as we look to create places to live that improve the quality of life for residents and visitors alike.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is estimated that by 2030, the world will have 43 megacities, each with more than 10 million inhabitants. Converting existing infrastructure to smart infrastructure is the key to improving cities. With unified data and analytics, smart city operators are empowered with better information, which means they can make more informed decision to optimize operations for the new environment in which they are operating.</p>\n<p>AVEVA\u2019s vast portfolio of smart city software solutions span facilities management, utilities, transportation, and data centers. Taking an integrated approach, AVEVA\u2019s solutions enable disparate functions to collect, analyze, and then act on unified and holistic intelligence \u2013 supported by the help of real-time data \u2013 to enable civic leaders to make better decisions and improve living standards.</p>\n<p>Due to the scalability of the solution, Unified Operations Center is ideally suited for not just megacities but also smaller municipalities looking to take an integrated system of systems approach to monitoring and controlling their city operations. AVEVA works with megacities such as London, as well as smaller municipalities with populations of 50,000 or fewer, that are looking to leverage technology to improve sustainability and resilience.</p>\n<p>AVEVA will be holding demos of its Unified Operations Center solution on Schneider Electric\u2019s stand H5-B40. Senior representatives from the company will be at GITEX Technology Week 2021 to meet with customers and partners and share their global success stories with them.</p>\n<p>-Ends-</p>\n<p><strong>About AVEVA</strong></p>\n<p><span>AVEVA is a global leader in industrial software, driving digital transformation and sustainability.
