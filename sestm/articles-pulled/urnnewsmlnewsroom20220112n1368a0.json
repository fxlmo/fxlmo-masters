Additionally in Q2, the Company will fund a 2,900 sq. m. extension to the Waddinxveen asset in the Netherlands on a pre-let basis to the current tenant, Combilo, at an attractive yield-on-cost. The aggregate funding requirement for these two assets is approximately \u20ac78 million</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2022 The Investment Manager is at an advanced stage of due diligence on four assets currently under exclusivity. Three assets are located in France, on long-term leases with a French national third-party logistics provider, and one asset is located in the Netherlands let to a well-established food focused operator.
