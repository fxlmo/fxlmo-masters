Our unique approach delivers rich, high-quality, interactive content to mobile XR devices while overcoming the otherwise intractable limitations of end-user devices. Simply put, we move the power and rendering burdens upstream to the cloud, then stream that content in real time to devices in a novel way that preserves the content\u2019s richness.\u201d</span>\n</p><p>\nUniquely, Mawari\u2019s patent-pending 3D streaming CODEC enables the highest visual quality to be streamed to mobile XR Devices by substantially lowering the heavy processing requirements of rich interactive and ultra-realistic 3D content like real-time digital humans, reducing cost, data size and battery consumption while unlocking scalability.\n</p><p>\nMawari\u2019s platform is compatible with modern web browsers or applications built with Unreal Engine and Unity, most importantly it is cross-platform and cross-engine by design. The platform\u2019s split rendering capability allows developers to decide what content should be rendered in the cloud versus on the end-user device where, for example, UI or lightweight content might ideally be rendered.\n</p><p>\nCEO Luis Oscar Ramirez Solorzano concludes:\n</p><p class=\"bwmarginl1\">\n<span>\u201cWhile others talk about the metaverse future, we are making it happen today. Our technological innovation is purpose-driven - our mission is to provide creative companies and developers around the world with the right tools and infrastructure, empowering them to bring the physical-world metaverse to life on as wide a range of mobile XR devices as possible\u2026 as soon as possible. Digital Human as a Service is just the beginning.\u201d</span>\n</p><p>\n1: AWS Marketplace: A managed and curated software catalogue that allows customers to find, buy and immediately deploy third party software\n</p><p>\n2: AWS Wavelength: AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services at the edge of 5G networks and enables developers to build applications and services that require increased speeds, massive bandwidth, and ultra-low latency, such as machine learning inference, Internet of Things (IoT), and video and game streaming.\n</p><p>\n<b>About Mawari Inc.</b>\n</p><p>\nMawari, Inc. has been pioneering the creation of cloud rendering and streaming technology for interactive XR experiences since 2018.
