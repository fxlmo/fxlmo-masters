After making her acting debut in James Franco's <span>Bukowski</span> , Morrone was then seen in several indie flicks like <span>Never Goin' Back</span> (2018), <span>Mickey and the Bear</span> (2019) and <span>Valley Girl</span> (2020). She got rave reviews for <span>Mickey,</span> where some even compared her to<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3097293/jennifer-lawrence-interview-oscar-winning-marvel-and\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, who also made her debut in an indie film.</p><p>She has also walked the runway for Moschino's 2017 resort collection, been featured in a Coach campaign with Kate Moss, appeared in <span>Vogue Turkey</span> and <span>Vogue Latin America</span> , and starred in ads for Topshop.</p><p>However, she has decided to focus on acting instead. \"Being on-camera and having a scene to do was the best feeling ever. I remember crying on the way home being like, 'I never want this to end! For the rest of my life!'\" she told Vulture.</p><p>Morrone is the daughter of famous Argentinian model Maximo Morrone and actress Lucila Sola, who got divorced after they moved to Los Angeles. In an interview with Vulture, she said she grew up going to auditions all the time and got a few commercials as well while attending Beverly Hills High School.</p><p>Morrone's mum once dated<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3144824/house-guccis-costume-drama-lady-gaga-looks-chic-most-cast\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Hollywood legend Al Pacino</a>from 2007 to 2015, and Morrone has even referred to Pacino as her stepfather. The three of them made their red carpet debut in 2014 at the 71st Venice International Film Festival, and Morrone said that she asked Pacino for acting lessons during her appearance on <span>The Late Late Show with James Corden</span> in 2018.</p><p>In 2019, she expanded her talent and teamed up with luxury brand Naked Cashmere for a capsule collection. As quoted in <span>WWD</span> , the new line \"focuses on essential travelling pieces \u2013 including long duster cardigans, jogger sets and bralettes\" with prices ranging from US$85 to US$595. The fashionista also used to run a lifestyle blog called cami-morrone.com, according to Insider, where she dished on her fashion tips, workout routine and favourite post-workout snacks.</p><p>Did you know Morrone also predicted DiCaprio's historic Oscar win for <span>The Revenant</span> on her blog? In 2015, Morrone wrote a short film review stating that she is a big fan of DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, but was unimpressed with the film. She then predicted his Oscar win, saying, \"Leo and Tom Hardy's acting was beyond amazing. This may be the year Leonardo DiCaprio finally wins an Oscar!\"</p><p>According to <span>Cosmopolitan</span> , the lovebirds met in 2017 at the Cannes Film Festival and were spotted spending New Year's in Aspen together. In 2018, the couple attended several events together, from Ellen DeGeneres' birthday party in West Hollywood to their big European holiday.</p><p>However, when the two sat next to each other at the 2020 Oscars, it unofficially confirmed their relationship despite the fact they walked the red carpet separately. In an interview with <span>LA Times</span> , Morrone also commented on their age gap: \"There's so many relationships in Hollywood \u2013 and in the history of the world \u2013 where<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3116604/harry-styles-and-olivia-wildes-age-difference-nothing-new\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">people have large age gaps</a>. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.\"</p><p>Morrone will be seen next in the highly-anticipated Amazon miniseries <span>Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</span> opposite Riley Keough. The Reese Witherspoon-produced show is based on Taylor Jenkins Reid's hit novel about the rise and fall of a dysfunctional 1970s rock band and Morrone will be playing Camila Dunne with Sam Claflin as her on-screen husband.</p><p>Speaking to <span>LA Times</span> , the young starlet said that she is not expecting \"an overnight success\" from the project, but she hopes it would put in a better position when fighting for a movie role \u2013 and, no, she doesn't want to be known only as DiCaprio's girlfriend. \"I feel like there should always be an identity besides who you're dating. \u2026 I understand the association, but I'm confident that it will continue to slip away and be less of a conversation.\" <br/><br/><span>Want more stories like this?
