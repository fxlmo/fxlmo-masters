The parent of search engine Google said on Tuesday that 2021 fourth-quarter revenue <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d72fc76\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">jumped 32%</a> year-over-year, and that losses are narrowing at its cloud computing unit. The shift to profit in data storage would be a big change for Alphabet, though maybe a less exciting one for its customers, if it brings an end to a long-running price war. </p><p>Google has spent a lot to catch up to bigger cloud rivals, Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> and Microsoft <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MSFT.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MSFT.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MSFT.O</a> <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2U542X\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2U542X\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>. Sundar Pichai\u2019s firm invested in engineers, sales staff and data centers while undercutting competitors on price. In the four years that the company has given numbers for the division separately it has made total revenue of about $47 billion, but cumulative operating losses of almost $18 billion. Yet the year just ended brought losses of just $3.1 billion, a 45% drop from 2020. That suggests that a year from now the division could head into the black.</p><p>Cloud computing has high barriers to entry, but that\u2019s also what makes it potentially lucrative. Microsoft last week said its cloud division had an operating income of $8.2 billion in the last quarter of 2021, giving it a 40% profit margin. If Alphabet can match that on what Refinitiv estimates may be $26 billion of cloud revenue this year, it could rake in $10 billion of operating profit \u2013 13% of what the whole company made in 2021. The 7% fall in Alphabet\u2019s shares in 2022 so far looks miserly in that light.</p><p>There\u2019s further to go before Pichai and his investors can reap the benefits of oligopoly. Amazon is the global market leader in cloud with 33% market share in the third quarter of 2021, while Microsoft was at 20% and Google <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RM2FH\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RM2FH\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> captured 10%, according to the Synergy Research Group. Closing that gap may mean plowing some profit back into the company. Alphabet hopes to spend more on signing up partners to service cloud customers, CNBC has reported. But once it rains, it ought to pour.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GinaChon\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@GinaChon</a> on Twitter</p><p>         </p><p>CONTEXT NEWS </p><p>- Alphabet said it had revenue of $75.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, a 32% increase from the same period a year ago.
