This was the same\n  case for the cash open in the US, but sentiment appeared to find a floor and\n  recovered after the London close. Tech and growth names led the bounce, with\n  heavy hitters including Netflix, Amazon and Tesla all trading well in a\n  reversal of recent weakness.\n* The bottom in stocks coincided with a statement from Russian foreign minister\n  Lavrov, who saw grounds for further discussions between Russia and the West -\n  a proposal which Russian President Putin duly accepted. The signs of progress\n  helped markets recover off bottom, with the threat of invasion in eastern\n  Ukraine seen tapering off in the very near-term.\n* The e-mini S&amp;P failed to hold above the 50-day EMA - at 4555.49. This average\n  still represents a firm resistance and a clear breach of it is required to\n  suggest scope for a stronger rally that would open 4671.75 initially, Jan 18\n  high. The Jan 10 candle pattern is a bearish engulfing reversal, signalling a\n  potential top and the recent move lower reinforces the pattern. A deeper\n  pullback would expose 4212.75.</pre>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Thomson Reuters Limited.</p></div>"}
