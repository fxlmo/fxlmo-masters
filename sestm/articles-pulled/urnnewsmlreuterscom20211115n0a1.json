Energy companies need solutions that help drive efficiencies to free up capital, time and resources to invest in discovering new, more sustainable energy sources for the future. Data and digital technologies can help to navigate this transition, yet an <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3357431-1&amp;h=799897312&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fthought-leadership%2Finstitute-business-value%2Freport%2Foil-gas-industry-innovation&amp;a=IBM+survey\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">IBM survey</a>\u00a0found that less than half of oil and gas executive respondents are using data to drive that innovation.

This is because one of the greatest values of that data is derived when it can be effectively combined, but usually this data is locked by data residency requirements, legacy applications or proprietary data formats,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Bill Vass</span>, vice president, engineering, AWS. \"By collaborating with IBM and leveraging Red Hat OpenShift, we will be able to offer customers a global, seamless offering with the flexibility to run on virtually any IT infrastructure and drive longer-term digital innovation.\"</p><p>The OSDU Forum is a cross-industry collaboration that provides a vendor-neutral framework for companies to develop data platforms against common energy industry standards. By working together, IBM and AWS will accelerate the value of this platform for global customers. The goal is that this combined effort will help serve the needs of energy companies today with flexibility to adapt to change amid energy transition. </p><p>\"Data is a critical asset to help fuel energy transition, yet too often energy companies must choose between running applications on-premises or in the cloud, and often each deployment uses a proprietary data format,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Manish Chawla</span>, global managing director, energy, resources and manufacturing, IBM. \"This means that rather than using all of that collective data to gather insights, augment operations and inform innovation, some of it was going unused.
