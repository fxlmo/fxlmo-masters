UPS stock jumped 16% to a record high of nearly $234 a share, as the company capped 2021 with double-digit revenue growth on the back of a continued surge in online shopping and labor shortages. Under CEO Carol Tom\u00c3\u00a9, who took charge in June 2020 as the health crisis raged, the logistics giant adopted a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter, not bigger\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy. It prioritized lucrative deliveries over volume and courted customers generating more revenue and profits, such as healthcare companies and small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs. Business with Amazon.com, its largest customer, also notched a healthy jump. The e-commerce behemoth's contribution to UPS' total revenue rose to 11.7% in 2021 even as concerns lingered over Amazon's development of its own logistics network. Much like other industries, UPS and rival FedEx Corp. have been grappling with supply chain challenges and rising Omicron cases among their staff. Still, it forecast a 2022 revenue of about $102 billion, above analyst estimates.</span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
