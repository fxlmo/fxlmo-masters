This highlights how difficult it can be for new players to crack this market.Earlier,\u00a0Amazon joined forces with Next Insurance\u00a0to offer customised small business insurance to eligible members in the US.Later, Next Insurance received $250m in additional funding, which took its valuation to $4bn.The small business-focused insurtech has raised $881m till now.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
