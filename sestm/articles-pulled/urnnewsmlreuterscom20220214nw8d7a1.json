Coming together with Amazon Music is a natural pairing. We share the same vision for my music, and I know that by working with them, I\u2019ll be able to make even my most ambitious plans a reality. I can\u2019t wait to share what we\u2019re working on with my fans,\u201d said BRELAND.\n</p><p>\nNew Jersey-born BRELAND began writing songs as a teenager, inspired by a diverse collection of sounds and eclectic artists like the Beatles, Rascal Flatts, Prince, and his number-one influence, Stevie Wonder. His debut single, \u201cMy Truck,\u201d fused hip-hop with country and became a breakout success, going platinum and ending up on best-of-the-year lists from NPR and <span>The New York Times</span>. Since signing to Bad Realm Records/Atlantic Records, BRELAND has collaborated with heavy-hitters such as Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts, Nelly, Blanco Brown, Lauren Alaina, and Chase Rice. He recently enlisted Keith Urban for the dynamic collaboration \u201cThrow It Back,\u201d and is currently featured on Dierks Bentley\u2019s single with HARDY, \u201cBeers On Me.\u201d Praised by <span>Rolling Stone</span> as \u201c1,000 percent the whole package,\u201d he made his Grand Ole Opry debut to a standing ovation last year.\n</p><p>\nAmazon Music has also unveiled details of the Breakthrough Development Fund, an initiative created to provide independent artists with additional financial support to help them as they launch their careers. The fund is the newest part of the Breakthrough program from Amazon Music, joining Breakthrough Live and the Breakthrough playlists supporting new artists. Each month, one independent artist in the U.S. will receive financial support that they\u2019ll be able to use to cover some of the costs artists face when starting out, like funding an early tour, hiring a PR or social team, and more. Thus far in 2022, Amazon Music has used the fund to support singer/songwriter Lauren Spencer-Smith in January and Muni Long in February.\n</p><p>\n\u201cHelping to develop artists is something that is very important to Amazon Music, and we understand that as their career starts to grow, each artist has different needs. Depending on where they\u2019re at in their career, they may need to build a strong team around them or to enhance their live show. With the Breakthrough Development Fund, we want to help artists build their teams and their profile,\u201d said Amazon Global Co-Head of Artist Relations Chris Graham. \u201cWhether we\u2019re backing artists with this new fund, providing a stage for their music on our Breakthrough playlists, or supporting them with the Breakthrough Artist program, Amazon Music is constantly working to help emerging artists find new fans and get to the next level of their careers.\u201d\n</p><p>\nBreakthrough is the emerging artist program from Amazon Music, aimed at amplifying the best new talent and championing them at different moments early in their careers. The program encompasses playlisting, livestreams, funding, marketing and social campaigns, events, editorial content, and more. Breakthrough has supported a wide variety of artists from around the globe, including U.S. hip-hop artist Blxst, country powerhouse Gabby Barrett, rising pop star Remi Wolf, London-based musician and poet Arlo Parks, rising German pop sensation Malik Harris, London singer/songwriter Olivia Dean, and Latin pop duo Las Villa.\n</p><p class=\"bwalignc\">\n(Download hi-res art <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Famznstudios.box.com%2Fs%2Fux0zz8nzuk4kw96xl2iq7coaamku2qss&amp;esheet=52578892&amp;newsitemid=20220214005570&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=1&amp;md5=70557e0c9408e5b4f641c342ccaf42fa\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">here</a>)\n</p><p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<span>For more information on Amazon Music, please contact David Marek (<a href=\"mailto:davmarek@amazon.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">davmarek@amazon.com</a>)</span>\n</p><p></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20220214005570r1&amp;sid=ny6r2&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9jdHMuYnVzaW5lc3N3aXJlLmNvbS9jdC9DVD9pZD1id25ld3Mmc3R5PTIwMjIwMjE0MDA1NTcwcjEmc2lkPW55NnIyJmRpc3Rybz1ueCZsYW5nPWVu&amp;key=0e1eb785fe44a8dd1279f4ee5125675296cf2370658de20d6b425573ba18b7579f970a96f7f55c25bc2d57094668927458b77700218ab842af9226f1db5fa5ac\"/></div></div><span class=\"bwct31415\"><p></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220214005570/en/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220214005570/en/</a></span></p><p>\nDavid Marek\n<br/><a href=\"mailto:davmarek@amazon.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">davmarek@amazon.com</a>\n</p></span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright Business Wire 2022</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-slugline\">Keywords: WA-AMAZON-MUSIC</p></div>"}
