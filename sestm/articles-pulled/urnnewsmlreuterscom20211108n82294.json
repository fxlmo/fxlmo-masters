After years of delay, Nigeria\u2019s central bank has given <a href=\"https://www.mtnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MTN-Nigeria-NGX-notification-Momo-PSB-051121.pdf\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">MTN</a> <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MTNJ.J\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MTNJ.J\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MTNJ.J</a> and <a href=\"https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/airtel_africa/news/rns/story/xoze82w\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Airtel Africa</a> <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AAF.L\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AAF.L\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AAF.L</a> the green light to offer basic banking via mobile phone. For the regulator, it\u2019s an attempt to keep a grip on technological disruption. For the operators, it\u2019s a potential multibillion-dollar payday.</p><p>Nigerian central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele first published guidelines for mobile money in Africa\u2019s biggest economy in 2018. That approval has taken this long is a testament to the power of the country\u2019s traditional lenders. With their nationwide network of airtime-selling agents, telecoms companies have unrivalled access to Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people, only half of whom have a normal bank account. Most of those would have jumped at the ease and simplicity of mobile money, which lets users send cash balances to friends or businesses via text message. Kenya, which pioneered the system a decade ago, boasts 68 million accounts in a country of 53 million people.</p><p>These figures point to rapid takeup when Airtel Money or MTN\u2019s MoMo get up and running in Nigeria. Using nearby Ghana as a yardstick, MTN can reasonably expect to convert 44% of its 77 million Nigerian voice subscribers into MoMo users. Assuming similar levels of usage and profitability, each Nigerian MoMo customer will generate $9.5 of annual EBITDA, or $320 million overall. JPMorgan analysts value Kenyan operator Safaricom\u2019s <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=SCOM.NR\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"SCOM.NR\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">SCOM.NR</a> M-Pesa unit at 18 times EBITDA. On a similar multiple, MoMo\u2019s Nigerian business would have an enterprise value of nearly $6 billion \u2013 equivalent to a quarter of its parent company\u2019s total worth.</p><p>That\u2019s probably an overestimate. After all, MoMo won\u2019t achieve those levels of penetration or profitability overnight. But if it gets there in three years, the business is worth nearly $4 billion, assuming a 15% discount rate. The 13% jump in Johannesburg-based MTN\u2019s shares on Friday, which added $2.6 billion to the company\u2019s market value, suggests investors see similar potential.</p><p>There\u2019s upside for Nigerian authorities, too. Onerous foreign-exchange controls and dollar shortages have pushed citizens to circumvent the central bank by using cryptocurrencies for overseas transactions. Many will also be doing so for domestic commerce, sidestepping the taxman. Emefiele\u2019s jitters at the prospect of Nigerians merrily zapping each other money via their phones are understandable. But the alternatives are much worse.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardcropley\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@edwardcropley</a> on Twitter</p><p><br/></p><p>CONTEXT NEWS</p><p>- MTN and Airtel Africa on Nov. 5 said Nigeria\u2019s central bank had granted the telecommunication companies \u201capproval in principle\u201d to operate mobile payment services in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.</p><p>- London-listed Airtel Africa said full approval for a financial services licence was subject to the company fulfilling \u201ccertain standard conditions\u201d within six months.
