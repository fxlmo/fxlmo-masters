In a January 22 letter, the US e-commerce giant said it is interested in pursuing a June 30, 2020 term sheet signed between Samara Capital, Future Retail and the promoters of the Indian retailer to acquire all retail assets of FRL, including the \"small-store formats\" comprising the \"Easy Day\", \"Adhaar\" and \"Heritage\" brands, through an Indian owned and controlled entity structure led by Samara and supported by Amazon for Rs.7,000 crore.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Amazon and home-grown investment firm Samara Capital have jointly invested in other Indian retail assets, including supermarket chain More from the Aditya Birla Group in 2018. India restricts foreign investments in multi-brand retailers to 51%, but the investments are subject to government approval.</p><p>Future Group has been fighting a bitter legal battle with Amazon for about 18 months in various courts in India and in Singapore to clinch the deal with RIL. The group owes about $2.5 billion to 20-odd creditors.</p><p>According to a person close to the developments, independent directors of FRL are preparing a response to Amazon's letter, reiterating their query about whether Amazon was authorized to negotiate on behalf of Samara Capital and if the latter was an entity owned and controlled by resident Indians. \"They have reiterated an offer that was rejected by the management of FRL two years ago. The company's problems have compounded since then. We have asked for a proposal that addresses the needs of lenders, employees, vendors and other stakeholders, and all they have done is to come back with the same offer. We asked for clarity on the status of Samara. There's no response to that either,\" the person said.</p><p>FRL is faced with the prospect of being dragged to bankruptcy court if it fails to service its debts by January 29. \"We face the prospect of bankruptcy and liquidation, and we need to be sure we are talking to a party with serious intent to help resolve it,\" the person said.</p><p>After Future Retail missed its December 31 repayment deadline for borrowing worth Rs.3,495 crore, the company now has time till January 29 to pay lenders, failing which it will be classified as non-performing. That is because FRL's loans were recast under the RBI's August 6, 2020 circular that permits a 30-day review period from the date of default for restructured loans. If the company is unable to repay by January 29, banks would have to set aside more than usual provisions as it would be considered that the account was never recast and had turned NPA on the date of implementation of the resolution plan.</p><p>\"We reaffirm our offer to assist FRL within the framework of our rights under the agreements,\" said Amazon in the letter.
