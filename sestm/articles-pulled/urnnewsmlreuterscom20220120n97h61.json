Amazon Style brings together the best of shopping on Amazon-great prices, selection, and convenience-with an all-new in-store shopping experience built to inspire.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Customers can browse brands they know and love while also discovering new and emerging designers across hundreds of top brands throughout the store. Using the Amazon Shopping app, customers can send items to a fitting room, where they can use a touchscreen to browse more options, rate items, and request more sizes or styles that are delivered directly to their room within minutes. Amazon Style combines Amazon's love of fashion with innovative technology and world-class operations to help customers find looks they'll love.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          The first Amazon Style store will open later this year at The Americana at Brand, a top shopping destination in greater Los Angeles. Here's what customers can expect:\n        </p>\n                  <h4>\n          A new way to shop and discover\n        </h4>\n                  <p>\n          Amazon Style offers a seamless and elevated shopping experience. Using the Amazon Shopping app, customers simply scan an item's QR code to see sizes, colors, overall customer ratings, and additional product details. With the tap of a button, shoppers can add the item to a fitting room or, if they don't need to try it on, send it directly to the pickup counter. Amazon Style offers more selection than a traditional store of its size-more than double the number of styles-without requiring customers to sift through racks to find the right color, size, and fit. Instead, Amazon Style features display items, bringing more looks and less clutter to in-store shopping.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Amazon Style is built around personalization. Our machine learning algorithms produce tailored, real-time recommendations for each customer as they shop. As customers browse the store and scan items that catch their eye, we'll recommend picks just for them. For an even more tailored experience, customers can share information like their style, fit, and other preferences to receive more refined recommendations. Even shopping for deals is personalized and convenient-customers can easily view deals in store that match their preferences right in the Amazon Shopping app.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Personal styling used to be expensive and feel exclusive, but with Amazon Style's sophisticated technology, unique store design, and thoughtful curation, we've made it easier than ever for customers to discover items they'll look and feel great in.\n        </p>\n                  <h4>\n          A reimagined fitting room\n        </h4>\n                  <p>\n          Amazon Style completely reimagines what's possible in the fitting room, turning it into a personalized space where customers can continue to shop a seemingly endless closet of great styles. When a shopper enters their fitting room, they will find the items they requested while browsing the store, plus additional options chosen based on their preferences.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Customers can continue shopping from their fitting room without having to leave. Using the touchscreen, they can rate items to get new picks in real time and request more styles and sizes to be delivered to their fitting room closet in just minutes. This fast delivery is made possible by Amazon Style's on-site operations, with advanced technologies and processes used in Amazon fulfillment centers.\n        </p>\n                  <h4>\n          Hundreds of brands and thousands of styles under one roof\n        </h4>\n                  <p>\n          Amazon Style offers unmatched selection using the expertise of fashion curators and feedback provided by millions of customers shopping on Amazon.com. Shoppers will find great looks at a broad range of prices, including trend-inspired pieces at affordable price points and sought-after styles that will become wardrobe staples. With Amazon's vast fulfillment center network, selection at Amazon Style will be frequently updated so customers can discover new items each time they visit.
