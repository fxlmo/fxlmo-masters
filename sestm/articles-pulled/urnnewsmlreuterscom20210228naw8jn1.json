These key hires demonstrate that AVEVA is investing in both sustainability and inclusion, in addition to our established Action for Good program, where we aim to have a positive impact on the communities, we operate in. Like many organizations we still have much work to do and so I am delighted to be part of the team driving change for the better,\u201d commented Caoimhe Keogan.</p>\n<p><strong>Fostering a Culture of Inclusivity</strong></p>\n<p>With a determined focus to develop an inclusive culture for all its employees, AVEVA recently hired Lena Milosevic MBE, as Global Director Diversity, Inclusion and Wellbeing. Lena has led diversity and inclusion throughout her career \u2013 for local government in the UK, through activism, to her career with the British Council.

I am thrilled to be working with hugely committed and talented colleagues across the globe to drive forward a coherent and constant program of interventions that are already beginning to make a difference,\u201d commented Lena Milosevic MBE.</p>\n<p><strong>Stepping Up to Build a Sustainable Future</strong></p>\n<p>Following the appointment of Lisa Johnston as Chief Sustainability Officer last year, Lisa Wee, joined AVEVA in August 2020 as Director of Sustainability, leading the development and coordination of the company\u2019s ESG strategy. Lisa has been working to advance corporate impact on sustainable development for her entire professional career, including through multiple roles at Chevron and more recently having built up a sustainability program at Under Armour. She has a successful track record across all major areas of sustainability, including strategy, program design, partnership development, employee engagement and ESG reporting. She is passionate about building relationships across cultures and with a wide range of stakeholders to help solve sustainability challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am very impressed that AVEVA\u2019s software already does a great deal to support sustainability, reducing emissions, boosting circularity, and supporting increased transparency and traceability across supply chains. The foundations are in place to accelerate AVEVA\u2019s sustainability journey and leadership in this important area,\u201d commented Lisa Wee.</p>\n<p><strong>Delivering AVEVA\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Research proves that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns if they create value for all their stakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, suppliers, and the wider society including the environment \u2013not just the leadership teams. Consequently, ESG focuses on how companies serve society and how this impacts on current and future performance. Consideration of future trends is also critically important and should inherently include disruptive change that can have significant implications for a company\u2019s future profitability or its very existence.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom addressing climate change to ensuring strong labor practices, talent management, product safety and data security, AVEVA fully recognizes the significance of the ESG aspects of business performance, including their impact on long\u2011term, sustainable value creation,\u201d commented Craig Hayman, CEO AVEVA. \u201cWe continue to aspire to a world where economic growth supports environmental sustainability, with better living standards for the communities in which we and our customers operate. This mindset is shared by our team, and these key hires demonstrate that AVEVA is committed to supporting industrial transformation, through a culture that promotes diversity and inclusion in the workplace,\u201d Hayman, concluded.</p>\n<div><b><span>Send us your press releases to</span>\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com</a></b></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnote-disclaimer\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
