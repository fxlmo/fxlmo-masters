As part of the plan, the company will also target a 50% carbon intensity reduction for so-called Scope 3, or emissions indirectly generated by Alibaba, from 2020 levels. In addition, Alibaba has developed the concept of Scope 3+, which it defines as \u201cemissions generated by a wider range of participants in a platform\u2019s ecosystem, currently outside of the Scopes 1, 2 and 3.\u201d It aims to cut a total of 1.5 billion tons of Scope 3+ carbon emissions by 2035.</p><p>- Alibaba held its annual investor day virtually on Dec. 16 and 17.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Editing by Antony Currie and Katrina Hamlin)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">((For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=MAK/\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"MAK/\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MAK/</a> <br/> SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href=\"https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe</a> | <a href=\"mailto:robyn.mak@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">robyn.mak@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://robyn.mak.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">robyn.mak.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
