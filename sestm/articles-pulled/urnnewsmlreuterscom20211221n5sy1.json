Included in the tests were nine WAF providers with a self-service offering: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Barracuda, Cloudflare, F5, Fortinet, Imperva, Prophaze, SiteLock, and StackPath. StackPath highlights in SecureIQ Labs final report include:<br/></p><ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>Leader for overall Return On Security Investment (ROSI) based on complete security, operational efficiency, and cost of ownership</li><li>Top performer for \"out of the box\" protection requiring little to no configuration</li><li>Top performer in operational efficiency\u00a0</li><li>High performer in botnet protection</li><li>100% Layer 7 DDoS attack protection score</li><li>High performer in WAF deployment time</li></ul><p>\u201cUnfortunately, in today\u2019s interconnected world, every company is a target for cybercrimes. There are so many bad actors with a multitude of attack scenarios and vectors,\u201c said David Ellis, VP at SecureIQLab. \u201cWe unbiasedly assessed the best security measures against real-world threats, and for operational deployment and ease of use. StackPath performed exceptionally in most of these categories and had a very competitive price point as well.\u201d</p><p>With each vendor, a member of the SecureIQ Labs technical team independently signed up for and configured the provider\u2019s WAF service. Default configurations and rule sets were used; any default \u201cdetect only\" mode settings were modified to \"block\" mode, with default rulesets used as applicable. The WAF was then subjected to more than 22,000 attacks.</p><p>\u201cOur WAF provides easy-to-access and manage enterprise grade protection and stops the malicious online attacks our clients face, including those from the recent Log4j vulnerability,\u201d said Uzi Galili, StackPath Senior Product Manager for Security Products. \u201cWe are glad that SecureIQ Labs recognized our capabilities. This recognition, combined with being identified as a \u2018Vendor to Watch\u2019 on Gartner's recent Magic Quadrant for Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) shows our security offerings help companies protect the edge.\u201d</p><p><strong>About StackPath</strong><br/>StackPath is an edge cloud platform, providing cloud services that are physically closer to end-users than core cloud providers\u2019 services.
