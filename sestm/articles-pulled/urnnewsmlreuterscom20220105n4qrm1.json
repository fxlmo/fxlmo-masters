The court deferred the hearing after the counsel for ED gave an oral assurance that it will not insist on physical appearance in view of the rising Covid cases. \u201cHold your hands in not calling them (Amazon staff),\" the judge told the counsel for ED.<br/><br/>The two companies fell out after debt-laden Future Group agreed to sell its retail, wholesale, warehousing, and logistics businesses in August 2020 to billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries in a $3.4 billion deal. The deal with Reliance is crucial to Future Group, which is on the brink of liquidation. Future Group\u2019s sell out to Reliance threatens the U.S. company\u2019s dominance in India.<br/><br/>Amazon tried to block the deal by getting a freeze order from Singapore arbitration court.  <br/><br/>Last month, the Competition Commission of India kept its approval for the 2019 deal between Amazon and Future Group on hold, accusing the U.S. company of hiding information while seeking regulatory approval.<br/><br/>The Delhi High Court yesterday dismissed Future Group\u2019s plea seeking directions to terminate ongoing arbitration proceedings at Singapore court. A hearing of an appeal against the order is still underway.<br/>   - By Ujjwal Narayan; Ujjwal.Narayan@newsrise.org; 01166767700<br/>- Edited by Dhanya Ann Thoppil<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
