They explore how Shein and other fast-fashion operations differ from traditional retail and how algorithm shopping is becoming second nature to us. And while the company's growth has brought with it a series of controversies, the piece acknowledges its smart approach to marketing, which has involved pouring funds into Google and Facebook advertising campaigns, influencer deals and a social-media reality show co-hosted by <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/khloe-kardashian\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Khloe Kardashian</a> . { <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2021/how-shein-beat-amazon-and-reinvented-fast-fashion/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Rest of World</a> }</p><p>Rebag closes Series E to enhance Clair technology <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/rebag\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Rebag</a> announced its largest funding round to date on Wednesday, closing a $33M Series E funding round led by high-growth PE firm Novator with return participation from General Catalyst.

The sales totaled 624 ETH, or about $2.6 million including royalties from aftermarket sales \u2014 nearly as much as the company has raised in venture capital funding from investors,\" Mondalek writes. \"That Vacation, a brand that's still relatively unknown, could not only grab attention with its NFTs but break through the noise at one of the industry's buzziest events is a prime example of how digital metrics of engagement and success \u2014 like number of Instagram followers \u2014 are becoming less important than creating a product or service that actually offers its community value.\" { <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/how-these-two-brands-raised-nearly-as-much-from-nfts-as-vcs/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Business of Fashion</a> }</p><p><a href=\"https://breakingmedia.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9ddd1593650687cb23ac29940&amp;id=a23c93579d\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Never miss the latest fashion industry news.
