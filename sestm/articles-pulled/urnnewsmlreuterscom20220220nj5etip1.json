Normally listed for $130.89, this 4-quart round Dutch oven with a glass lid can be yours for as low as $99.95 in cherry red, black and white. We named the larger Staub cast iron 5.5-quart round cocotte (from $319) the best Dutch oven we've ever tested, so this smaller model is sure to impress with the tempered glass lid for optimal heat control and a multi-coat enamel\u2014which the brand claims is resistant to chips, scratches and discoloration. The pot is designed for searing, boiling, deep-frying, braising and more in the oven, and works on both induction and traditional stovetops.</p><p><span>Get the Staub Cast Iron 4-Quart Round Cocotte from $99.95 (Save $5.62 to $107.65)</span> </p><p><big>2. 32% off: Our favorite affordable pillows\u00a0</big> </p><p>Sleep soundly with a new set of Beckham Hotel Collection bed pillows, the best affordable pillows we've ever tested.

Save $150: Our favorite air fryer\u00a0</big> </p><p>Air fryers make cooking a whole lot easier, but some of the best models can be pretty pricey. Fortunately, our favorite air fryer, the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL, is currently selling at as much as 43% off at Amazon.
