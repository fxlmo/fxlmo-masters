But Lockheed Martin\u2019s <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=LMT.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"LMT.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">LMT.N</a> failed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AJRD.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AJRD.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AJRD.N</a> shows that for now, the old thinking still holds true too. </p><p>Lockheed <a href=\"https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2022-02-13-Lockheed-Martin-Terminates-Agreement-to-Acquire-Aerojet-Rocketdyne\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">dropped</a> its $4.4 billion deal for Aerojet after a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission, which Khan chairs. Earlier this month, semiconductor giant Nvidia <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=NVDA.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"NVDA.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">NVDA.O</a> <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">walked away</a> from its $40 billion deal for UK chip designer Arm after a similar challenge. On one hand, both of these were so-called vertical deals, where a customer buys a supplier rather than a rival. Those are less frequently challenged by regulators.</p><p>On the other hand, the FTC\u2019s opposition to both deals follows a familiar template. In each, an acquirer was set to buy a uniquely important supplier to its peers. Antitrust enforcers have protested against such issues before. Though the FTC approved Northrop Grumman\u2019s <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=NOC.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"NOC.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">NOC.N</a> 2017 purchase of Orbital ATK, it <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810005_northrop_bureau_statement_6-5-18.pdf\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">said it did so</a> for the benefit of the Department of Defense, despite concerns. It also <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-cancer-detection\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">challenged</a> gene-sequencing firm Illumina\u2019s <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=ILMN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"ILMN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">ILMN.O</a> vertical deal with Grail. And in 2017, the Department of Justice tried to prevent AT&amp;T <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=T.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"T.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">T.N</a> from acquiring Time Warner. </p><p>Meanwhile, in areas that companies and their investors feared radical change, little has happened. The market priced in substantial antitrust risk to a variety of pharmaceutical mergers \u2013 all of which passed muster. The Department of Justice allowed media giant Discovery\u2019s <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=DISCA.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"DISCA.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">DISCA.O</a> merger with WarnerMedia, even after members of Congress raised concerns. </p><p>Khan wants to enlarge the FTC\u2019s notion of what constitutes an unacceptable merger, as shown by efforts to discard current guidelines for analyzing deals and start from scratch. Yet so far, there\u2019s no evidence of a big shift. Instead Khan has moved deliberately, issuing enforcement actions at a relatively slow pace <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2S11NK\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2S11NK\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> while racking up uncontroversial, bipartisan votes <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2U53XA\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2U53XA\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> on deals. </p><p>That\u2019s made it seem like much of the shift at the FTC has been about preventing transactions <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2TZ38L\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2TZ38L\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> before they\u2019re announced, rather than after.
