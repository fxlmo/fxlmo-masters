Amazon needs to mitigate the impacts to the environment and community fully.\"</p>\n<p>\"I took offense when the mayor said a job is a job,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Herrera</span>, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 396. \"If these politicians prioritize corporations over people, they should be voted out of office.
