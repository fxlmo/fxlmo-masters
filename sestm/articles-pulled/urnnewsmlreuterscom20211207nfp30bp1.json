What was noticeable about all three trades was the strength of demand. <strong>NTT Finance</strong>, for example, saw combined books of more than \u20ac6.5bn. An ESG label - the bonds were issued under a green use-of-proceeds structure - may have played a part, as it may have done on Latvia's deal. But even so there were encouraging signs that investors have yet to shut up shop.</p>\n              <p>The US dollar market, meanwhile, was busy with eight issuers, including <strong>Banco de Chile</strong>, raising US$16bn. So although there are central bank meetings to navigate, Monday's deals might yet encourage one or two more issuers to try their hand before year-end.</p>\n              <p>Indeed, risk-on price action has extended across global markets overnight. Nominally it has come amid easing anxiety over the Omicron variant of Covid-19, although Treasuries erasing the excess exuberance after last Thursday\u2019s superficially weak US employment report, and setting up for big duration supply over the rest of the week, has also played a role.</p>\n              <p>Ten-year Treasury futures are down a few ticks from their settle, but are down almost half a point from when Europe went home. S&amp;P futures meanwhile are up more than 25 points or 0.6%, after the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% yesterday.</p>\n              <p>Asian bourses show the Nikkei up 1.9%, and the CSI300 up 0.3%. The dollar has given back much of yesterday\u2019s moderate gains, the index easing to DXY96.20, with the euro slightly stronger at EUR/USD1.1294. The yen in contrast is slightly weaker at USD/JPY113.71. Gold is a little higher at US$1,781.60, and Bitcoin continues to recover after Saturday\u2019s sharp sell-off, up slightly to over US$51,000.00. Oil is also strong, Brent crude up US$0.84 at US$73.92.</p>\n              <p>Finally, Turkey\u2019s lira remains steady below USD/TRY14.000, but still has not rallied from this level, and so remains poised to break weaker above last Thursday\u2019s high of USD/TRY13.9000, and so presumably in short order last week\u2019s high of USD/TRY14.0000, beyond which we can only guess at when it will eventually stabilize.</p>\n              <p>News from overnight saw the Reserve Bank of Australia leave policy unchanged, as had been expected, and come across with a neutral statement.</p>\n              <p>Sudip Roy: +44(207) 542 4617, sudip.roy@refinitiv.com\u00a0</p>\n              <p>Robert Hogg: +44(207) 542 9077, Robert.Hogg@refinitiv.com</p>\n              <p>Client Support: IFR.Clientsupport@refinitiv.com</p>\n              <p>Subscription sales:</p>\n              <p>Asia-Pacific &amp; Japan: cmi.asiasales@refinitiv.com</p>\n              <p>Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa: cmi.emeasales@refinitiv.com</p>\n              <p>Americas: cmi.americassales@refinitiv.com</p>\n              <p>(Reporting by Sudip Roy)</p>\n              <p>((sudip.roy@refinitiv.com; +44 207 542 4617))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
