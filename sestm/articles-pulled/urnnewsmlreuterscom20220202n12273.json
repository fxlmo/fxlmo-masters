However, when that first month kicks off red, stocks rose only 2.7% on average over the rest of the year and were higher only 62% of the time.</p><p>However, LPL also says that it isn\u2019t all bad news though, as lately the January Barometer hasn\u2019t been very reliable.</p><p>\u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting that the January Barometer has been broken lately. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times stocks were lower in January, the final 11 months were higher, with some huge gains in there.\u201d</p><p>LPL also drilled down to look at what happens in the wake of an especially bad January, like just occurred. Their data implies some continued weakness in February \"could be in the cards,\" and they add that performance over the final 11 months has been \"quite muted as well.\"</p><p>In any event, LPL says they are encouraged by last week's \"big reversal\" in stocks and they think that a \"meaningful bottom\" is in the process of forming.</p><p>\"But the truth is this year is going to be much more volatile than last year and investors had better buckle up their seat belts if the first month is any indication.\"</p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>EARNINGS SEASON AT MIDPOINT: GLASS HALF-FULL OR HALF-EMPTY?
