Local data by ZIP code including historical weather data, 15-day forecast weather data, and relative data such as hot, cold, windy and other conditions could also be used to help inform campaigns, supply chain and forecasting decisions. This data can even help surface unique or non-obvious relationships between weather and consumer behavior.</p>\n<p>\"We know that weather can impact nearly everything in daily life -- how we feel, what we do, even what we buy,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Sheri Bachstein</span>, Chief Executive Officer at The Weather Company and General Manager of IBM Watson Advertising. \"This expanded relationship with AWS gives more businesses access to the weather data\u00a0that can drive consumer behavior and purchasing.\u00a0We are committed to opening up our insights and technology to a broad set of organizations, and giving more companies access to what we know can be growth- and efficiency-driving data and tech.\"</p>\n<p>Insights that show locations where weather could affect sales can help businesses drive revenue based on predictive consumer behavior.\u00a0According\u00a0to past IBM Watson Advertising research,\u00a0data revealed that while chocolate candy bar sales generally go up in colder months across the U.S., sales can spike in the Southwest when a higher heat index is expected, and in the Northeast during muggy nights. In another example, while more bug spray is purchased during the summer months, foggy conditions in the Northwest can drive more sales while clear conditions can drive demand in central states. </p>\n<p>AWS Data Exchange helps make it easy to find, subscribe to, and use third-party data from providers in the cloud.
