U.S. Closed-End\nFunds (the \"Funds\" or individually the \"Fund\"), today announced that the\nFunds paid the distributions noted in the table below on October 29, 2021,\non a per share basis to all shareholders of record as of October 22, 2021\n(ex-dividend date October 21, 2021).\n\n(figure style=\"width:477.9pt;\")\n//st\n\n  Ticker   Exchange        Fund                                     Amount\n\n  ASGI     NYSE            Aberdeen Standard Global                 $\n0.1083\n                           Infrastructure Income Fund\n\n  FAX      NYSE American   Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund,       $\n0.0275\n                           Inc.\n\n//et\n\n     Each Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with\na stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized\ncapital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital.\n\n     Under applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of\ndistributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined\nonly as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related\nrules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated\nsource of certain distributions to shareholders.\n\n     The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of\nthe distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules\nadopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally\naccepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and\npercentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for\nthe cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the\nfollowing sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital\ngains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The\nestimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated\ncomposition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains\nand losses on securities and currencies.\n     Each Fund's estimated sources of the current distribution paid this\nmonth and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:\n\n(figure style=\"width:461.2pt;\")\n//st\n\n  Estimated Amounts of Current Distribution per Share\n\n  Fund           Distribution   Net Investment     Net Realized     Net\nRealized    Return of\n                 Amount         Income             Short-Term\nLong-Term       Capital\n                                                   Gains **         Gains\n\n  ASGI           $0.1083        $0.0000      0%    -            -   -\n-   $0.1083   100%\n\n  FAX            $0.0275        $0.0146      53%   -            -   -\n-   $0.0129   47%\n\n//et\n\n(/figure)(figure style=\"width:461.2pt;\")\n//st\n\n  Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year* to Date Cumulative Distributions per\nShare\n\n  Fund            Distribution   Net Investment     Net Realized     Net\nRealized    Return of\n                  Amount         Income             Short-Term\nLong-Term       Capital\n                                                    Gains **         Gains\n\n  ASGI            $0.1083        $0.0000      0%    -            -   -\n-   $0.1083   100%\n\n  FAX             $0.3300        $0.1749      53%   -            -   -\n-   $0.1551   47%\n\n//et\n\n     * ASGI has a 9/30 fiscal year end; FAX has a 10/31 fiscal year end.\n\n     **includes currency gains.\n\n     Where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution\nto be a \"Return of Capital,\" it means that Fund estimates that it has\ndistributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of\nyour distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur\nfor example, when some or all of the money that you invested in a Fund is\npaid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily\nreflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with\n\"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\n     The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are\nonly estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The\nfinal determination of the source of all distributions for the current year\nwill only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the\namounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment\nexperience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to\nchange based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a\nForm 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that\nwill tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax\npurposes.\n\n     The following table provides the Funds' total return performance based\non net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds'\nannualized and cumulative distribution rates.\n\n//st\n\n  Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information\n\n  Fund             Average       Current         Cumulative    Cumulative\n                   Annual        Fiscal          Total         Distribution\n                   Total         Period's        Return on     Rate on NAV\n\n                   Return on     Annualized      NAV\n                   NAV for       Distribution\n                   the 5 Year    Rate on NAV\n                   Period\n                   Ending\n                   09/30/2021\n\n  ASGI            15.87%3       5.84%           22.39%        5.84%\n\n  FAX             3.21%         7.38%           3.09%         6.77%\n\n//et\n\n(/figure)     1 Return data is net of all Fund expenses and fees and\nassumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained\nunder the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.\n\n     2 Based on the Fund's NAV as of September 30, 2021.\n\n     3 The Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and\ndistribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July\n29, 2020) through September 30, 2021.\n     Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment\nperformance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the\nterms of the distribution policy (the \"Distribution Policy\").\n\n     While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment\nperformance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in\nthe Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined\nby the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the\nFund's shares in the open market.\n\n     Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more\nfrequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and\nRule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during\nthe year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term\ncapital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and\nshort-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary\nincome rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income\nearned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum\nrate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any\ncalendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net\ncapital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of\nundistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that\nreduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of\ncapital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital\ngain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares\nhave been held at the date such amount is received.\n\n     The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution\nPolicy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the\nFund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating\nexpense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the\nextent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value\nper share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's\ninvestment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold\nlarger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that\nthe Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the\npurpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to\namend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The\namendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect\nthe Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax\nadvisor regarding federal, state and local tax considerations that may be\napplicable in their particular circumstances.\n\n     Circular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements\nimposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice\ncontained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended\nor written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding\npenalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or\nrecommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\n     In the United States, abrdn is the marketing name for the following\naffiliated, registered investment advisers: Aberdeen Standard Investments\nInc., Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd., abrdn Australia Limited, abrdn Asia\nLtd., Aberdeen Capital Management, LLC, Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs\nAdvisors LLC and Aberdeen Standard Alternative Funds Limited.\n\n     Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the\nstock exchanges.
