update:\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        \"Our first half financial performance has been strong. The first half of last year, and especially Q1, was impacted by the start of Covid, but even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates for the half year for the Group and all our service segments are ahead of our FY'21 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms these are all in strong double digits.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The risks from Covid still remain, with sub-Saharan Africa continuing to experience a third wave of the pandemic. Governments continue to implement balanced measures of lockdowns and restrictions accordingly. But vaccination levels remain low, and we continue to monitor the situation for potential impacts on economies and consumers.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Operationally we have continued our network modernisation and expansion, aligned with an extension of our distribution capabilities, which have together contributed towards continued strong growth in ARPUs across voice, data and mobile money. We have seen an improvement in our customer growth trends for the Group as we approach stability of net monthly movements in Nigeria.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Alongside our results we have today launched our sustainability strategy. Airtel Africa has always been a business with a sustainable premise at the heart of our purpose to transform lives across Africa through our promotion of both digital and financial inclusion. Our sustainability strategy builds upon this, extending and more comprehensively articulating our sustainability goals and credentials. I am excited by the new initiatives we have launched and I look forward to reporting back on our developments in this area with our first sustainability report next year.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        1\n      </p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <p>\n        As incoming Group CEO, I have inherited the responsibility to build upon a business with solid foundations and as I look ahead, I continue to see huge potential across voice, data and mobile money from low penetration levels across Africa. The continent continues to be a growth story for us despite the pandemic. We will continue to invest in mobile and digital technologies to drive digital and financial inclusion sustainably in Africa. I am pleased with the progress we have made in the last couple of years on delivering value to everyone touched by our network.\"\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Airtel Africa plc (\"Airtel Africa\" or \"Group\") results for half year ended 30 September 2021 are unaudited and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the same period.

recorded another strong set of results that demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy, with strong performance across our regional segments and key services. Reported revenue grew by 25.2%, with constant currency growth of 27.6%. Regionally, revenue in Nigeria grew by 32.4%, in East Africa by 25.8% and in Francophone Africa by 22.1% in constant currency. We were able to deliver strong double-digit growth across all key services; our voice revenue grew by 19.7%, data revenue by 36.9%, mobile money revenue by 42.0% and other revenue by 24.1%. As a result, mobile services revenue grew by 25.5% in constant currency (22.9% in reported currency) and mobile money services revenue grew by 42.0% (42.7% in reported currency). The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth rate for Q2'22 of 22.7% was lower than the 33.1% of Q1'22 primarily due to a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Net finance costs were lower compared with the previous period due to higher derivatives and forex loss of $11m in the prior period. Tax charges increased by $96m due to higher operating profit, a one-time tax settlement charge of $9m and higher withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries, with the prior period also benefitting from $10m deferred tax credit recognition.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Basic EPS and EPS before exceptional items significantly improved to 7.6 cents and 7.5 cents respectively, with higher profits more than offsetting the associated increased tax.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Leverage improved to 1.5x at 30 September 2021 from 2.2x in the previous period, largely driven by increased cash generation, expansion in underlying EBITDA and $375m of receipts from the first closings of the mobile money minority investments, and despite investing $247m of intangible capex renewing licences in two of our largest markets, Nigeria and Uganda, and acquiring additional spectrum. Our balance sheet has also been further de-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        GAAP measures\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Revenue\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Revenue in reported currency grew by 25.2% to $2,272m. The constant currency growth rate of 27.6% was partially offset by currency devaluations, mainly in Nigerian naira (6.1%) and Zambian kwacha (10.8%), in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc (4.9%) and Ugandan shilling (4.7%). Revenue growth for the half year partially benefitted from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region<span>.</span> Even after adjusting for this, revenue growth rates for the half year were ahead of FY'21 growth trends for the Group, and across all reported service segments.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Operating profit\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Operating profit increased by 55.1% to $732m in reported currency, due to a combination of strong revenue growth and improvements in operating efficiency.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Net finance costs\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Net finance costs were lower by $22m as a result of stable net interest costs, lower foreign exchange losses of $11m (mainly driven by appreciation of the Zambian kwacha) and a one-time $11.9m gain in other finance charges as a result of the reversal of an interest provision in one of our operating entities.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The Group effective interest rate increased from 4.8% to 5.5% largely driven by the repayment of the Eurobond in May 2021 which carried a lower than average coupon, and higher local currency debt at the OpCo level.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Taxation\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Total tax charges were $232m, an increase of $96m, largely due to higher operating profit, a one-time tax charge and higher withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. The prior period also benefited from the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $10m in Tanzania.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Profit after tax\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Profit after tax was $335m, an increase of 131.6% on the prior period. This increase was largely due to higher operating profits along with lower net finance costs, which more than offset the increase in tax charges due to increased profits.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Basic EPS\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        Basic EPS improved to 7.6 cents, up from 3.0 cents in the prior period.
