The software giant\u2019s $69 billion bid for the maker of \u201cCall of Duty\u201d is likely to run into trouble in Washington, which opens up the fray to rival bidders \u2013 particularly those who covet video game assets, and don\u2019t face Microsoft\u2019s high risk of regulatory challenges.</p><p>Microsoft agreed on Tuesday to pay Activision $95 per share in cash.

Yet investors are already telegraphing trouble ahead. Activision\u2019s stock was trading at about a 15% discount to the offer price on Wednesday. Throw in a hefty break fee of up to $3 billion and it suggests regulatory risks are on the horizon.</p><p>While Microsoft hasn\u2019t come in for scrutiny in the way Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=GOOGL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"GOOGL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">GOOGL.O</a>, Facebook owner Meta Platforms <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=FB.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"FB.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FB.O</a> or Apple <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AAPL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AAPL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AAPL.O</a> have, it\u2019s reasonable to think a $69 billion acquisition will raise hackles.

Netflix fits the bill. Its leaders Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have already highlighted gaming as a priority, and singled out Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite as a rival for viewers\u2019 attention. Netflix recently launched mobile games around franchises including \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Unlike Microsoft, it currently doesn\u2019t have a full-fledged gaming business.</p><p>True, the streaming firm has huge cash obligations to fund movies like \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up,\u201d and is forecast to spend more than $18 billion this year according to MoffettNathanson estimates. But with a market value of $226 billion, it could always throw in a slug of stock. Though Netflix shares have sagged recently, they\u2019ve delivered an annual return of 30% over the past five years, almost twice the return on Activision shares.</p><p>Part of that is precisely because Netflix has shunned splashy value-destructive acquisitions. Nonetheless, Hastings and Sarandos are right to worry about the competitive threat from Activision, Epic and their peers. And the only way to win is to play the game.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennifersaba\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@jennifersaba</a> on Twitter</p><p>         </p><p>CONTEXT NEWS </p><p>-  Microsoft said on Jan. 18 it plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95 a share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision\u2019s net cash. </p><p>- The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said on the same day that they had begun the process of revising the agencies\u2019 merger guidelines.</p><p>- Netflix will report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 20.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Editing by John Foley and Sharon Lam)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">((For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=SABA/\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"SABA/\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">SABA/</a> <br/> SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href=\"https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe</a> | <a href=\"mailto:jennifer.saba@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">jennifer.saba@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://jennifer.saba.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">jennifer.saba.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
