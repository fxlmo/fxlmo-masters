The EV Range Expert demo showcases how\nBlackBerry IVY is leveraged to develop enhanced experiences for a family\nembarking on a road trip in their electric vehicle.\n\n     At the booth, visitors can see in real-time the AI-based decisions\nbeing made by BlackBerry IVY and what the in-car experience could look like\nfor drivers and passengers though a physical car dashboard. Incorporating\ntechnology from BlackBerry IVY ecosystem partners including HERE\nTechnologies, Car IQ(r) and Electra Vehicles, the demo illustrates powerful\nuse cases that can be enabled via the platform in the form of enhanced\npredictions, intelligent recommendations and in-car payment capabilities\nthat utilize in-vehicle data from multiple sensors.\n\n     Leveraging Electra's EVE-Ai(TM) 360 Adaptive Controls for battery pack\noptimization, the demo provides an accurate battery state of charge (SoC)\nand range prediction based on driver detection and personalization, while\nactively working to extend range and preserve battery lifetime.\nAdditionally, the demo ingests preloaded HERE Technologies' data to provide\ntailored guidance, pricing and availability of vehicle charge stop\nlocations, more efficient routes with carbon footprint estimates, and\nindividual driver customizations. A third integration via Car IQ creates a\n\"digital fingerprint\" for the vehicle, allowing it to securely connect to a\nbank, card payment networks and in-vehicle marketplaces that allow the car\nto validate and autonomously pay for a wide range of frequently used\nservices, including EV charging, tolls, parking, insurance, maintenance,\nand other payment and wallet capabilities. The multi-OS, distributed\narchitecture demonstration features BlackBerry IVY running on both Linux\nand QNX across gateway and digital instrument cluster domains, in\ncollaboration with KPIT Technologies.\n\n     \"There's no better place than CES to showcase what the future of\nmobility will look like and it's a real thrill to finally lift the curtain\non BlackBerry IVY and show to the world the vast potential that it can\nunlock for OEMs, Tier 1s and end users alike,\" said Vito Giallorenzo, SVP\nCorporate Development &amp; Chief Operating Officer, IoT. \"BlackBerry IVY\nallows automakers to develop a better understanding of how vehicles are\nused and can be improved while allowing software developers to create\nenhanced services and experiences for drivers. Being able to see in\nreal-time how the platform enables all this is incredibly powerful and a\ngreat a catalyst to help those from across the transportation industry\nre-imagine all that is possible when you have the right tool, and I'm sure\nthere will be no shortage of these 'light bulb' moments when visitors see\nit for themselves.\"\n\n     BlackBerry's full suite of automotive offerings will be demonstrated\nat the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas from January 5 - 8,\n2022, at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
