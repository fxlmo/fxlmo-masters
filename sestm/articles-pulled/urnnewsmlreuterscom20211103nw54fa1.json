The completion of the Digital Wallets cloud migration is part of a global multi-year agreement with AWS that supports Paysafe\u2019s cloud strategy.\n</p><p>\nThe move to AWS has enabled Paysafe to scale its Digital Wallet operations to drive increased efficiency and innovation behind its consumer solutions and reduce the deployment time of its merchant integrations by approximately 80%, accelerating time to market for its business customers.\n</p><p>\nThe migration of Paysafe\u2019s Digital Wallets services represents the completion of the transition of the company\u2019s broad portfolio of mission critical workloads to the cloud with AWS. It follows the transition of Paysafe\u2019s eCash solutions earlier this year.\n</p><p>\nBy moving its mission critical workloads to the cloud, Paysafe now has the ability to open up new revenue streams by combining numerous business lines to create innovative and frictionless services based on real-time insights. At the same time, the company is poised to make considerable savings in hardware investment costs by operating in the cloud.\n</p><p>\nPaysafe\u2019s Digital Wallets portfolio offers a popular alternative payment method for consumers, with the ability to send and spend money online from a Skrill or NETELLER account. It allows customers to upload funds from credit and debit cards, bank accounts and a variety of alternative payment methods and use those funds to send money to friends and family or spend online. Customers can also use a prepaid card. For merchants, it provides a platform that supports multiple payment methods including credit cards, prepaid cards and real-time banking solutions. Merchants using Skrill and NETELLER are able to promote their services to millions of users around the world.\n</p><p>\nPaysafe believes it will increase efficiencies and reduce its liabilities in merchant underwriting by using AWS\u2019s global infrastructure and data modelling solutions, including its risk analytics services. Paysafe has also transitioned its disaster recovery completely to AWS as part of its move to develop and deploy next-generation capabilities using AWS\u2019s comprehensive portfolio of cloud services.\n</p><p>\nPaysafe\u2019s cloud platform now positions the company to power its growth strategy in 2022 by offering additional products and bolt-on services with its partner ecosystem.\n</p><p>\nRoy Aston, Chief Information Officer at Paysafe, said: \u201cWe began our relationship with AWS at the onset of the pandemic, and we have developed a deep collaboration between our two companies over the last 18 months. By moving the majority of our critical workloads to the cloud, we have been able to rapidly respond to new market conditions and changing consumer needs. We are excited to continue our strategic collaboration with AWS and further solidify our commitment to developing new cloud-native consumer wallet products for our business and consumer customers.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cPaysafe\u2019s dedication to modernizing its infrastructure using AWS is a testimony to the company\u2019s commitment to deliver innovative payment solutions for its consumer and business clients,\u201d said Scott Mullins, Managing Director, Worldwide Financial Services Business Development at Amazon Web Services. \u201cWe look forward to our continued collaboration with Paysafe, and we are excited to support the company\u2019s mission to become a fully cloud-based payments provider.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<strong>About Paysafe Limited\n<br/></strong>Paysafe Limited (\u201cPaysafe\u201d) (NYSE: PSFE) (PSFE.WS) is a leading specialized payments platform.
