My success has been, in great\npart, because I try to remain true to the values my parents taught me.\"\n\n     Putting our core character traits into action is what it means to live\na life in harmony, writes Guest, an active musician who began playing in\nrock bands his teen years.\n\n     \"In music, harmony happens when notes blend so it's pleasing to the\near. Whether someone performs in a band, a choir, or an orchestra, nothing\nis quite as exhilarating as achieving perfect harmony with fellow\nmusicians.\n\n     \"In life, harmony means living a consistent and honest arrangement of\nyour values and solidly committing to living those values day in and day\nout.\"\n\n     Noting that everyone has defining life moments when choices align with\ndestiny and catapult a person in an unanticipated direction, Guest urges\ncourage.\n\n     \"These moments can paralyze us, or they can transform us, profoundly\nreshaping us for the better, leaving us with fresh insights, new goals, and\nstrengthened resolve,\" he writes.\n\n     \"But with your values defined, love, kindness and respect for others,\nespecially now, will foster harmony in relationships that literally\nenriches life and makes it more rewarding.\"\n\n     Written expressly to help others find life's success secrets, All the\nRight Reasons uncovers 12 principles for living a life in harmony.
