The Notes are complex financial instruments. They are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors, especially retail investors. In some jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom), regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Notes.

For these purposes, a \" <span>UK Retail Investor</span> \" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation (as defined in the Preliminary Offering Circular) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to UK Retail Investors has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any UK Retail Investor may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation (as defined in the Preliminary Offering Circular).</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, pursuant to COBS, the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available in the UK to retail clients (as defined in COBS 3.4) in the UK.</p>\n<p>\n<span>EU PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors</span> - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a \" <span>retail investor</span> \" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.</p>\n<p>LEI number of abrdn plc: 0TMBS544NMO7GLCE7H90</p>\n<p>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
