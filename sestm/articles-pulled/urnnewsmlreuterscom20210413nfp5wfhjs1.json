The seller will be locked up for 90 days.</p>\n              </blockquote>\n              <p>\n              </p><p>Regular issuer <strong><span>Nexity</span></strong> was slightly caught out on Tuesday on its return to equity-linked as investors failed to bite on a new issue within launch terms due to the strong rally in the French property developer's shares over recent weeks and months.</p>\n              <p>The liability management exercise saw the company buying back convertibles and financing that with a new seven-year issue, reprising the same trade it did in 2016. The buyback passed its minimum threshold of securing 60% of the outstanding \u20ac270m of 0.125% 2023s in the morning and later in the afternoon the premium range was revised down to drive demand for the new issue.</p>\n              <p>There was no pre-sounding ahead of the offer of 2028 bonds with the <span>OCEANE</span> structure (convertible into new or existing shares) with a coupon of 0.375%\u20130.875% and a premium of 40%\u201345%. The base size was set at \u20ac240m, with a \u20ac30m upsize option.</p>\n              <p>The repurchase price of \u20ac66.60\u2013\u20ac66.90, including accrued interest, was a 0.5%\u20131% premium to a market level of \u20ac66.20, according to a banker on the deal. Those bonds are still out of the money with a conversion price of \u20ac50.8703, according to Refinitiv data, versus Tuesday's close of \u20ac44.28.</p>\n              <p>The key reference for the new issue was the seven-year CB issued by Nexity in 2018, with those using an ORNANE structure (net-share settled) and paying a 0.25% coupon. Those 2025s are still pretty balanced with a conversion price of \u20ac57.0447 and were used to calculate a credit spread of 270bp on the new bonds, with implied volatility at launch of just below 24% to just over 30%.</p>\n              <p>The new bonds offered a higher coupon in addition to seeking a higher premium compared to the existing bonds. As neither of the outstanding bonds is in the money or broken the relative value was important. Investors felt that a share price that has nearly doubled since late October and is up 20% since late February has little further to go so the 40% premium was too high, said a second banker. Shares closed at \u20ac44.60 on February 26 2020 ahead of the Covid sell-off.</p>\n              <p>The premium was revised to 35%\u201340%, with pricing to follow at 35% with a 0.875% coupon. Final terms were still to be published at 7:30pm in London but bankers on the deal said the change had the desired effect, leading to a high-quality book. Long-only investors were dominant, as expected with a French issuer, and many investors were switching into the new CB. The company opted not to push and kept the deal at \u20ac240m.</p>\n              <p>The bonds can be called from four years with a 130% hurdle and there is a clean-up call at 85%. Dividend protection is included.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole </span>and <span>JP Morgan </span>were joint bookrunners.</p>\n              <p>Subscription for <strong>Air <span>France-KLM</span></strong><span>'s</span> capital increase opened on Tuesday with shareholders offered 186.1m shares at \u20ac4.84 to raise \u20ac900.7m, rising to \u20ac1.036bn with an extension option.</p>\n              <p>Subscription runs until Thursday, but banks have already lined up buyers if shareholders do not want all the offered stock.</p>\n              <p>On Monday evening an <span>ABB</span> of \u20ac255m was completed, but allocations will only be confirmed once orders from shareholders have been filled.</p>\n              <p>Shares were offered in the <span>ABB</span> at a range of \u20ac4.84 to the market close of \u20ac5.314 and priced at the bottom, representing a discount of 8.9% and setting the price for the whole fundraising.</p>\n              <p>The airline operator said that the strength of demand in the <span>ABB</span> means it will exercise at least half of the upsize option so proceeds will be at least \u20ac968.2m. Full exercise of the upsize option will see its share capital increase by 50%.</p>\n              <p>The French state, the company's largest shareholder with a stake of about 14.29%, is investing \u20ac590m in the capital increase, and China Eastern Airlines \u20ac110m.
