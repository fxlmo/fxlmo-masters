It was billed as a way for sellers to avoid constantly monitoring and changing product prices. Instead, Amazon would optimize the price, guaranteeing sellers a minimum price. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon used the program to prevent third-party sellers from undercutting Amazon's prices. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>This hurt consumers, the lawsuit alleges, because it removed the possibility that a specific product would be discounted. It also hurt sellers, according to the complaint, because it led consumers to more often buy products directly from Amazon, since third-party sellers did not offer a lower price.</p><p>As part of the legally binding resolution filed Wednesday, Amazon must check in with the attorney general's office once a year for five years, certifying that it is in compliance with the agreement.</p><p>\"This was a small program to provide another tool to help sellers offer lower prices, much like similar programs common among other retailers, that has since been discontinued. While we strongly believe the program was legal, we're glad to have this matter resolved,\" said Amazon spokesman Glenn Kuper.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 The Washington Post</p></div>"}
