Customers can now review their monthly bills in Arabic, check past statements, details of electricity and water consumption, their carbon footprint, as well as connect their DEWA account to other Amazon accounts. Customers can also benefit from Rammas, DEWA\u2019s virtual employee, which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Amazon\u2019s Alexa devices in Arabic to answer their enquiries. Moreover, customers can benefit from the Smart Living initiative, which enables them to make smart decisions to reduce their consumption proactively and digitally as well as solve problems and causes for increased consumption or waste on their own; without contacting DEWA.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe strive to shape the future, keep pace with global developments and smart technologies to develop work mechanisms in order to enrich the customer experiences and make them happier. This supports the vision and directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to develop the Government of Dubai and make it ten years ahead of other cities. We are proud that DEWA is the first government utility in the world that provides its services in Arabic on\u00a0 Amazon Alexa. This reflects DEWA\u2019s continuous efforts to achieve the maximum benefit from AI and disruptive technologies to provide the best smart services to its customers. DEWA was the first government entity in the UAE to add Rammas to this innovative technology since 2017 to enable customers to enquire about their bills anytime. Moreover, DEWA enables its customers to complete their transactions anytime and anywhere easily and safely on its website and smart app as well as other smart and digital channels. This saves their time and efforts and enhances their happiness as well as contribution to protecting the environment, natural resources and reducing carbon emissions,\u201d said <strong>HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD &amp; CEO of DEWA</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to see DEWA making their services available to its customers on Alexa, introducing an innovative and more sustainable way of engaging with government utilities. Just by using their voice, customers benefit from a broad range of innovative DEWA services that not only save time and resources but also provide inspiration to lead a more sustainable life,\u201d said <strong>Eric Saarnio, VP Devices &amp; Services, Amazon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Smart adoption of DEWA\u2019s services reached 98.9% in the third quarter of 2021. DEWA received the 100% Paperless Stamp from Dubai Digital Authority, recognising its efforts in completing the digital transformation of all its services and operations by 100%. DEWA also provides Rammas services round the clock in Arabic and English on its website, smart app, Facebook, Google Assistant, robots, and WhatsApp Business on 046019999.</p>\n<div><b><span>Send us your press releases to</span>\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com</a></b></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnote-disclaimer\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
