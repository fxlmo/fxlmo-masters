There's also the Fitbit Sense, typically listed for $299.95 but now available for $199.95, or 33% off, which is also one of the\u00a0best fitness trackers we've ever tried for its\u00a0emphasis on tracking and managing stress via an electrodermal activity sensor and an ECG app that measures the electrical activity of the heart to detect irregular rhythms.</p><p><span>Save up to 35% on Fitbit fitness trackers</span> </p><p><big>2.
