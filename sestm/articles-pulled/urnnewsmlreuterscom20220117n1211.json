It was filed in Third Judicial Circuit in Madison County, Illinois.</p><p>It alleges that the Amazon knew that conditions were \"highly unsafe as tornado warnings had been issued,\" but company officials \"rolled the dice with peoples' lives to put profit over safety,\" attorney Jack J. Casciato said.</p><p>\"We are seeking damages in excess of multi-millions of dollars,\" Casciato said.</p><p>Kelly Nantel, an Amazon Spokesperson, said the warehouse was built in compliance with all codes and that Amazon managers followed the weather conditions closely.</p><p>\"We believe our team did the right thing as soon as a warning was issued, and they worked to move people to safety as quickly as possible,\" Natel said in a statement to Reuters.</p><p>\"We will defend against this lawsuit, but our focus continues to be on supporting our employees and partners, the families who lost loved ones, the surrounding community, and all those affected by the tornadoes,\u201d she said.</p><p>On Dec. 10, a barrage of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km). <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2T03T7\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2T03T7\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>The six workers in an Amazon delivery station were among more than 70 who died throughout the region.
