There is no additional configuration required.Faster onboarding: AWS users can use a one-click deployment in the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to connect the EKS environment to Calico Cloud. Existing accounts in landing zones will already be enrolled and will not require extra work to connect. Linking landing zone accounts with the Calico Cloud account is done automatically.Eliminate setup monitoring: Users spend minimal time managing and monitoring their setup for enabling EKS security and observability via Calico Cloud. Integration also scales as the number of landing zones increases.Multi-cluster and Multi-region controls: A centralized, unified, multi-cluster approach to security and observability can help with faster troubleshooting, adherence to compliance requirements, and uniform policy enforcements across regions, distributions, and dataplanes.Scalability and automatic updates: As EKS clusters are enrolled via AWS Control Tower, security and observability is automatically applied with no additional work required.\"The Calico Cloud integration with AWS Control Tower takes the pain out of setting up security and observability for EKS deployments and provides a centralized point of control to secure and monitor the health of cloud-native applications running on multiple AWS accounts across regions,\" said Amit Gupta, vice president of business development and product management, Tigera.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
