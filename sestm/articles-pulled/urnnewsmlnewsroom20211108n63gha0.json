(\"GlobeX\" or the \"Company\"), the leader in Swiss\nhosted secure communications and secure data management, is pleased to\nannounce that is has completed its first Government sale of its\nSekurMessenger solution, to a Latin American government entity. The\nCompany expects more licenses to be sold in 2022 and beyond and sell a\nmix of Sekur, SekurMessenger and when they come out in 2022, the\nSekurPro video conferencing solutions and SekurVoice encrypted voice\nsolutions.\n\n     Alain Ghiai, CEO of GlobeX Data said: \"We are very excited to\nhave completed our very first Government license sales of\nSekurMessenger in Latin America, and we expect more to come in 2022.\nOnce one organization enjoys our solution, others are expected to\njoin. As a matter of privacy, we will keep the name of the client\nconfidential as part of the terms of the sale. We expect many more\nlicenses to be sold in Latin America and other regions, such as South\nAsia, in the coming years. The sale was completed fast, as the client\nrecognized immediately the benefits of SekurMessenger over using any\nother messaging application. We look forward to have them get to know\nthe many unique and critical features provided by Sekur and\nSekurMessenger such as, Swiss hosted data privacy and security, and\nthe right for government organizations not to have their data mined by\nthird party service providers, Big Tech companies, or rogue\ngovernments stealing valuable information and confidential data\ntransiting during communications. As we are not connected, and never\nhave been connected, to AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud\nplatforms, commonly referred to as \"Big Tech\", we can offer a truly\nindependent, private and secure means of communications such as secure\nand private emails and instant messaging. We are looking forward to\nprotect everyone, consumers, businesses and now governments from\nmalicious hackers, and offer them true data privacy and no data\nmining.\"\n\n     Sekur , which includes SekurMessenger as part of a bundle of\nemail, messaging and file transfer into one app solutions, includes\nthe Company's latest SekurMail technology, which includes proprietary\nanti-phishing and privacy feature called SekurSend (R). SekurSend (R)\nlets a user send an email to any other recipient, whether they have\nSekur or not, in full privacy and security as the email never leaves\nSekur 's encrypted email servers based in Switzerland. The recipient\ncan then click on the notification and reply in the same manner using\nSekurReply (R) , without the recipient having to register for a Sekur\naccount. The sender can also decide to protect any email sent by\nadding a password to open it, a read-limit and a self-destruct timer\nas well. Sending an email with the SekurSend (R) feature allows the\nsenders and recipients to add limitless size attachments to the emails\nwithout crowding the recipients' email box. This also eliminates BEC\nattacks for businesses and email phishing attacks. Additionally,\nSekurMail includes full control of email delivery, automatic data\nexport for large Enterprises and an automatic Data Loss Prevention\ntechnology (\"DLP\") with real time continuous archiving.\n\n     Recent data breaches in messaging applications and in particular\nin the WhatsApp application have created a certain urgency for\nbusinesses and data privacy advocates to protect their communications\nform cyber-attacks and identity theft via mobile and desktop devices.\n\n     SekurMessenger eliminates many of the privacy and security risks\nby not only not requiring a phone number, which would divulge a user's\nphone device ID, but also by not social engineering a user's phone or\ncomputer contact list and infecting the contacts by default as well,\neliminating a huge loophole in security and privacy. SekurMessenger\nissues each user a username and a SM number. The SM number is the\ncontact ID a user would disclose in order for other SM users to be\nadded. The service comes with a self-destruct timer and other features\nas well, including GlobeX's proprietary VirtualVaults and HeliX\ntechnologies with all data stored in Swiss hosted encrypted servers.\n\n     Additionally, SekurMessenger now comes with a proprietary feature\nand technology called Chat by Invites. This feature allows a\nSekurMessenger user (\"SM user\") invite a non-SM user, or a group of\nnon-SM users, to chat in a fully private and secure way, without the\nrecipient ever having to register to SekurMessenger or download the\napp. At the end of the chat, the initiator of the conversation can\nremotely terminate the conversation and all traces of the conversation\nare deleted from all users, including the recipient. This unique\nfeature is now fully deployed and functional on all iOS and Android\ndevices and web platforms. The target sectors are numerous, including\nbut not limited to real estate, legal, financial, government, energy,\nmining, manufacturing, trade and medical sectors.\n\n     GlobeX's Data privacy solutions are all hosted in Switzerland,\nprotecting users' data from any outside data intrusion requests. In\nSwitzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the\nSwiss Federal Constitution. The Federal Act on Data Protection\n(\"FADP\") of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict\nprotection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of\npersonal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects.\nThe protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data\nProtection and Information Commissioner.\n     Under Swiss federal law, it is a crime to publish information\nbased on leaked \"secret official discussions.\" In 2010 the Federal\nSupreme Court of Switzerland found that IP addresses are personal\ninformation and that under Swiss privacy laws they may not be used to\ntrack Internet usage without the knowledge of the individuals\ninvolved.\n\n     About GlobeX Data Ltd.\n     GlobeX Data Ltd. is a Cybersecurity and Internet privacy provider\nof Swiss hosted solutions for secure communications and secure data\nmanagement.
