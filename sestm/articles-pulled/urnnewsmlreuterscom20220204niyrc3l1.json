It's also one of the brightest OLED TVs we've ever seen, and is exceptional at capturing colors.\u00a0The A90J also\u00a0has two different stand positions, that let it\u00a0either stand on adjustable feet so you can slide a soundbar underneath or with the feet to the side of the panels supporting the screen.\u00a0</p><p>The A90J also comes loaded with features that appeal to\u00a0cinephiles and gamers alike. Two of its four HDMI ports support 4K content, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos-compatible sound systems to get the most out of games on the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox Series X. Its internal speakers are also capable of\u00a0spatially positioning audio based on the location of the subjects in the frame. One of the TV's biggest improvements is in its interface software, jumping from Android TV to Google TV for faster menu navigation and easier user interface.\u00a0</p><p>If you're looking to get the most out of your favorite shows, movies and games, the Sony A90J is a great\u00a0choice.\u00a0Be sure to shop fast though, as a deal this good means this deal won't last long.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Get the Sony A90J Bravia XR\u00a0OLED 4K Ultra HD Smart Google TV at Amazon from $2,298 (save $501.99 to $2,001.99).</p><p><span><span>There's more where this deal came from.</span> Sign up for Reviewed's Perks and Rec newsletter and we'll keep 'em coming every Sunday through Friday.</span> </p><p><span>The product experts at <span>Reviewed</span> have all your shopping needs covered.
