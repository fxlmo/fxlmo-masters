Francis Maguire report.<br/>Short Link: <a href=\"https://refini.tv/3EXLYH5\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://refini.tv/3EXLYH5</a><br/><br/>Video Transcript:<br/><br/>Amazon is in talks to settle two EU antitrust investigations. That's according to people close to the matter Tuesday. It comes a year after the European Commission first charged Amazon. The world's largest online retailer is accused of using its size, power, and data to push its own products. Brussels argues this gives it an unfair advantage over rival merchants that sell on its online platform. The Commission also investigated Amazon's treatment of its own retail offers, and those of marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services. Sources told Reuters Amazon is in preliminary discussions with EU regulators. It has reportedly offered concessions to address the EU's concerns. Any settlement could help avert a huge fine and orders to change its business practices. The Commission can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover. Based on last year's revenue that could total just under $39 billion for Amazon. The company's troubles might not finish there. Amazon also faces an antitrust lawsuit in Washington D.C. over its agreements with wholesalers and third-party sellers.</span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
