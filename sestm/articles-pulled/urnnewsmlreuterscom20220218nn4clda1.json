Microservices, APIs and cloud services are complex and continuously changing. Traceable AI enables security to keep up with engineering and the continuous pace of change and protect modern applications from modern threats. Traditional security solutions like Web Application Firewalls are too static and too slow to react and respond with new rules to constantly changing applications and changing threats. Traceable applies the power of machine learning and distributed tracing to understand the DNA of the application, how it is changing and where there are anomalies in order to detect and block threats, making businesses more secure and resilient.
