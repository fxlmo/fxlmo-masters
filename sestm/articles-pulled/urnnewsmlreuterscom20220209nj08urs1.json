The bench also included justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli. In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended the clearance for the 2019 deal between Amazon and Future, saying that Amazon failed to notify it about certain crucial details of its acquisition as required under the law. CCI also imposed a penalty of Rs.202 crore on Amazon.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Based on the CCI order, Future moved the Delhi high court seeking stay on the ongoing arbitration proceedings before the SIAC.</p><p>While Future's plea was rejected by a single-judge bench, a division bench on January 5 stayed the proceedings before the tribunal, citing the CCI order as one of the reasons. It added that irreparable loss would be caused to Future if proceedings are not stayed. The division bench was expected to hear the case on February 1 but it got adjourned to March 21. Amazon challenged the high court's stay order before the SC. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.
