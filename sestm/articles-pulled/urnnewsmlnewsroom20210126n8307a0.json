I am confident that the Company is today in the strongest position it has ever been, led by an exceptional executive group and a strong board who are successfully implementing a clear strategy. Following the acquisition of Huddle on 23 December 2020 and with a further deal progressing well it is the right time to announce my retirement. I now look forward to effecting a smooth transition before my departure in May and I thank all employees, partners, customers and investors who have supported the Group over the years.\".</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>Commenting on David's retirement Ben Dorks said:</span>\n</span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I have worked closely with David for the last 8 years.
