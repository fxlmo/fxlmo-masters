Completion is expected to occur in Q4 2021. The proceeds from the transaction will be used to repay debt and related break costs of 3i Infrastructure's holding company, Oystercatcher. The balance of the proceeds will be distributed to 3i Infrastructure, which we estimate will not exceed c.\u20ac50 million. The sale price achieved implies an increase in 3i Infrastructure's NAV of c. \u20ac110 million or c.10p per share, before any revision to the value of Oiltanking Singapore Limited, and this increases Oystercatcher's unrealised money multiple to 2.8x and unrealised IRR to 13.5% over the Company's 14 year investment period.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>During 3i Infrastructure's ownership, the terminals have benefitted from strong, long-term demand for liquid storage capacity and have achieved consistently high utilisation levels. Our partnership with Oiltanking has seen the terminals invest to upgrade and expand storage and jetty capacity and improve environmental and safety performance, and thereby remain the terminals of choice for their customers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Richard Laing, Chair of 3i Infrastructure, commented:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"3i Infrastructure was a pioneer among infrastructure investors into the liquids storage sector 14 years ago and Oystercatcher has proven a good investment for the Company over that period. Now is an appropriate time for the four European terminals to move to new ownership, well-placed to support them into the future.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Phil White, Managing Partner and Head of Infrastructure, 3i Investments plc, Investment Manager of the Company, added:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Oystercatcher is another successful investment for the Company and we have achieved a sale of the European terminals at an attractive price. The management and staff of all four terminals have been a pleasure to work with throughout the life of our investment and we thank them for their commitment and excellent performance over that time. We wish them every success under new ownership.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>-ENDS-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For further information, contact:</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Thomas Fodor</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Investor enquiries</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Kathryn van der Kroft</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Media enquiries</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tel: +44 207 975 3469</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Email:</span>\n<span>\n<a href=\"mailto:thomas.fodor@3i.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">thomas.fodor@3i.com</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tel: +44 20 7975 3021</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Email:</span>\n<span>\n<a href=\"mailto:kathryn.vanderkroft@3i.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">kathryn.vanderkroft@3i.com</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Notes to editors:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>3i Infrastructure plc</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>3i Infrastructure plc is a Jersey-incorporated, closed-ended investment company, an approved UK Investment Trust, listed on the London Stock Exchange and regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
