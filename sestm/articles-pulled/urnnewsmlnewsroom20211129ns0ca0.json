(\"Beyond Medical\" or the \"Company\")\nis pleased to provide the following corporate update regarding its\nwholly-owned subsidiary Micron Technologies Inc. (\"Micron Technologies\").\n\n     New Variant of COVID-19\n\n     In response to the discovery of a new COVID-19 variant the federal\ngovernment of Canada is implementing a travel ban on several south African\ncountries including South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana,\nLesotho and Eswatini. In addition to Canada, the European Union, Israel,\nJapan, India, and Great Britain have all imposed travel bans on numerous\nSouth African countries. The restrictions have been implemented following\nthe discovery of a new variant of COVID-19 in South Africa. South Africa's\nMinister of Health, Joe Phaahla, stated, \"Initially, it looked like some\ncluster outbreaks, but from yesterday, the indication came from our\nscientists from the Network of Genomic Surveillance that they were\nobserving a new variant.\"\n\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new variant\nidentified in South Africa, named \"Omicron\", as a \"variant of concern\". The\nWHO deems new variants to be either a \"variant of interest\" or a \"variant\nof concern\", the latter being the more serious of the two. Further, a\nstatement issued by the WHO on Friday stated \"this variant has a large\nnumber of mutations, some of which are concerning\" and that evidence\ngathered thus far indicates that the variant carried a higher risk of\nreinfection than other variants.\n\n     Manufacturing Three-Ply Medical Grade Face Masks at Full Capacity\n\n     Micron Technologies has been manufacturing and selling three-ply\nmedical grade Level 3 face masks in Delta, B.C. since August 2020.
