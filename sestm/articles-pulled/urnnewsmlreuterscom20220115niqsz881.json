The NCLAT, on Thursday, while rejecting Amazon's plea to put on hold CCI's decision, asked both the regulator and Future Coupons to file their reply within the next 10 days.</p><p>Why does Amazon want the NCLAT to set aside the CCI decision on Future Coupons deal?</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>A primary argument that Amazon pleaded before the NCLAT was that since the deal with Future Coupons was signed in 2019, the CCI could not have gone back more than 12 months to review and subsequently suspend the deal. The counsel for Amazon also questioned how the competition regulator could have revisited its own order allowing the deal almost after two years.</p><p>What will happen next in the Amazon-Future Coupons legal tussle?</p><p>So far, both Amazon and Future Group have filed more than a dozen cases against each other in various forums, such as the Delhi High Court, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court. Apart from this, both these companies are also engaged in arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).</p><p>On the next hearing in the NCLAT on February 2, Amazon will try to prove why the CCI could not have revisited its earlier order when it had granted its approval for the deal, while Future is likely to argue that since the deal has now been suspended, the NCLAT should not entertain the plea.</p><p>Apart from the NCLAT, Amazon and Future Group are also battling the case out in the Supreme Court, where the Future Group has challenged the Delhi High Court's refusal to grant stay on an arbitration tribunal decision refusing to interfere with the Emergency Award (EA) of the SIAC.</p><p>Copyright 2022 IE Online Media Services Pvt.
