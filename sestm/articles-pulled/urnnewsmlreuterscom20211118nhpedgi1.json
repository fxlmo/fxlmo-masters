For instance, you can get a 75-inch 5-Series 4K QLED Roku Smart TV at a 33% discount for $999. When we tested the 5-Series, we were impressed with its wide color range and decent overall contrast (especially for a TV in its price range), not to mention the built-in Roku technology from the makers of our favorite streaming device. Those looking to upgrade the sound of their TVs can get an Alto 8i Dolby Atmos soundbar for just $99.99. Normally listed for $179.99, this 39.4-inch device features built-in subwoofers and Bluetooth technology that lets you get\u00a0richer sound\u00a0from movies and music.\u00a0</p><p><span>Save up to 44% on TCL 3-Series, 4-Series and 75-Inch TVs plus Alto 6 and 8i Soundbars</span> </p><p><big>2.\u00a0Save $212: One of our favorite Roombas</big> </p><p>The iRobot Roomba i3+ is usually priced at $599.99 on its own but today, you can get\u00a0the\u00a0vacuum with authentic replacement parts included for $442.98 thanks to a 32% discount.

In our testing, we found the i3+ picked up an average of 11 grams of dirt per run, which is on par with our favorite robot vacuum, the iRobot Roomba i7+ ($749).\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the iRobot Roomba i3+ with Replacement Parts for $442.98 (Save $212)</span> </p><p><big>3.\u00a037% off: These mini smart plugs</big> </p><p>Get more control over your home electronics with this two-pack of Kasa Smart Plugs.

The Fire Stick 4K MAX is available for $34.99 (36% off its list price of $54.99) and the standard Fire TV Stick is on sale for $19.99 (50% off its list price of $39.99). Amazon claims the 4K MAX is 40% more powerful than the Fire Stick 4K, which we named one of the best streaming devices for its excellent remote and support of major streaming services like Disney+, Prime Video and more. The 4K MAX has that same remote and multi-service compatibility but promises faster app starts and smoother navigation through its interface. Though the standard Fire TV Stick doesn't offer the same upgraded picture and sound quality when streaming, it still has the feature-loaded remote and promised faster streaming.</p><p><span>Get the Amazon Fire TV Stick for $19.99 (Save $20)</span> </p><p><span>Get the Amazon Fire Stick 4K MAX for $34.99 (Save $20)</span> </p><p><big>3.
