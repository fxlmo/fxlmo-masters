(NYSE American: YCBD, YCBDpA), one of the leading, most highly trusted and best recognized CBD companies, today announced their multi-year exclusive agreement with Amify, an Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) platform partner, to prepare for the inclusion of CBD products within the Amazon marketplace. Amify, which specializes in Amazon go-to-market strategies, content creation and operational excellence, will act as cbdMD\u2019s exclusive CBD partner to launch products on the Amazon platform as soon as the category is accepted and becomes available. This partnership includes all the leading and award-winning cbdMD branded products, including cbdMD\u2019s gummies, tinctures, gelcaps and topicals, as well as the award-winning Paw CBD animal brand. In addition, the new line of skin care and beauty products under the brand cbdMD Botanicals will also be available.\n</p><p>\nInterest in CBD becoming more readily available has grown exponentially since the passage of the Farm Bill in 2018, and cbdMD believes Amazon is expected to become a major platform to distribute CBD products. To prepare for the category inclusion, cbdMD has worked with Amify to create seller central accounts, build product pages and other essential components of cbdMD\u2019s Amazon store and established Amazon launch strategies in order to fully utilize the Amazon platform. Aside from assisting brands in effective brand and product marketing with their award-winning advertising and content, Amify also works to manage storefronts, oversee the inventory and demand planning and handle customer service and returns with an expert in-house team. Amify refers to its unique approach as being a provider of \u201cAmazon-as-a-Service.\u201d The company is responsible for creating, developing and executing effective customized Amazon strategies that align with broader sales and ecommerce goals. With this exclusive partnership, cbdMD is poised to fully integrate their digital marketing, content curation and product innovation with the world\u2019s largest online retailer.\n</p><p>\n\u201cAs an industry, this is the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for, and we believe we are close. When a global retailer like Amazon is ready to accept your products, you get your strategy prepared and perfected so you\u2019re ready to go to market as soon as possible. That\u2019s exactly what this partnership represents. We are already one of the largest online CBD businesses in America, and this distribution channel will play into our strength. We are excited to be at the forefront of this category inclusion and we\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to properly prepare for launch. Whenever that launch is, we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Chairman &amp; Co-CEO Martin Sumichrast.\n</p><p>\n<b>About Amify</b>\n</p><p>\nAmify delivers turnkey, award-winning services to help brands launch, manage and continually optimize their Amazon channel strategy.
