Despite that surge and significant risks, the technology giant run by Tim Cook can continue to evade the law of large numbers. </p><p>No public company has ever been as big as the iPhone maker, which now accounts for 7% of the S&amp;P 500 Index. After Microsoft <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MSFT.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MSFT.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MSFT.O</a> caught up a few months ago, Apple pulled ahead again easily. Google owner Alphabet <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=GOOGL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"GOOGL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">GOOGL.O</a> tips the scales at less than $2 trillion, as do oil behemoth Saudi Aramco <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=2222.SE\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"2222.SE\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">2222.SE</a> and e-commerce pacesetter Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>.</p><p>Apple\u2019s revenue, $366 billion in the most recent fiscal year, is in the same ballpark as the GDP of Israel or Hong Kong. The company returned nearly <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4'21-Return-of-Capital-Timeline.pdf\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">$200 billion</a> to investors through share buybacks and dividends last year, more than the entire market value of any but the top 40 or so groups in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>For more than a decade leading up to 2019, the company's shares typically traded at a price-to-earnings ratio discount to the broader market. That's no longer the case, but today's stock price doesn\u2019t look badly overstretched. At roughly 30 times earnings, it\u2019s only a little richer than the S&amp;P 500 overall. An enterprise value of about 8 times revenue makes Apple cheaper than, say, Microsoft. Adjusting for one year\u2019s forecast growth, per Refinitiv, provides the only hint that Cook has his work cut out: A higher price-earnings-to-growth or PEG ratio suggests more demanding expectations for Apple than for most other tech giants.</p><p>There are threats to the hefty percentage that Apple extracts from app developers like Epic Games, which is challenging Cook\u2019s company in court <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2ML39O\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2ML39O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>. Those income streams matter for top-line growth. And China, which accounted for a fifth of revenue last fiscal year as well as being a key supplier for sales elsewhere, is a source of both supply-chain and trade-policy uncertainty. </p><p>Still, after a decade at the helm, Cook has capitalized on the crown-jewel smartphone created by his predecessor, Steve Jobs <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RO1E8\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RO1E8\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>. With what seem like only incremental product enhancements and merely ancillary revenue from the app store and services, Apple's financial results have <a href=\"https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/why-apple-just-might-be-the-first-1-trln-company\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">surprised doubters</a>.
