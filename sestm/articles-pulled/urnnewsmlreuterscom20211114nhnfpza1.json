The agency is currently in the process of grading the area.</p><p>During a protest on the site on Friday, activists and the indigenous people slammed the development as the \"antithesis of what Bezos was pledging\" as the site was the \"ecosystem of endangered flora and fauna and was the green lung of the city\".</p><p>Tauriq Jenkins of the Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Indigenous Traditional Council said: \"This site is also the epicentre of colonialism, resistance and dispossession of land. When we lose the river, we lose everything. When the world's richest man and richest company put a price on something sacred to most of us, we have to hold the line.\"</p><p>Jenkins described the site as the place where the \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" for the San and Khoi people would take place.</p><p>\"It recognises the untold intergenerational trauma that for so long has not been addressed. This is the ground where we can tell our children that the wiping out of indigenous communities began.</p><p>\"The first Frontier Wars were fought here in 1659, which resulted in a 180-year series of wars of resistance by the San and Khoi, the extinction of sacred animals, and forced removals of indigenous people,\" he said.</p><p>Jenkins said the site was also part of the 1520 Battle of d'Almeida in which Portuguese \"colonists\" were defeated.</p><p>Later, it became the site of 180 years of resistance against the Dutch settlers and also marked the first privatisation of land for commercial objectives.</p><p>Protester John Daniels said the developers should stop the project and move it \"elsewhere\".</p><p>\"There's lots of other pieces of land that the City of Cape Town could have chosen to allow the development. I have no problem with Amazon wanting to create employment opportunities, but not on this sacred ground, not at the expense of the Khoi nation and heritage,\" said Daniels.</p><p>London said the interdict application would be followed by another court attempt to review and declare the approval decisions by the provincial government and the City of Cape Town unlawful.</p><p>\"We have a strong case based on the impacts on heritage and the multiple violations of environmental policies involved. We have an excellent legal team, which includes Cullinans Attorneys (environmental and green business law firm) and Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi as our silk,\" said London.</p><p>Weekend Argus \u00a9 1999 - 2021 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.
