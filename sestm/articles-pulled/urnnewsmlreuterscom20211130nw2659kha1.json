To receive the designation, AWS Partners undergo a rigorous technical validation process, including a customer reference audit. The AWS Energy Competency provides energy customers the ability to more easily select skilled partners to help accelerate their digital transformations with confidence.\n</p><p>\n\u201cValidere is proud to achieve the AWS Energy Competency designation,\u201d said Nouman Ahmad, co-founder and CEO, Validere. \u201cOur team is dedicated to helping companies get the most out of their data by leveraging the agility, breadth of services, and pace of innovation that AWS provides so they can be more commercially and environmentally efficient.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAWS is enabling scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions from startups to global enterprises. To support the seamless integration and deployment of these solutions, AWS established the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fpartners%2Fcompetencies%2F&amp;esheet=52541976&amp;newsitemid=20211130005363&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=AWS+Competency+Program&amp;index=1&amp;md5=f37ea4b626493d1f4afdc50ff1b0a0b9\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Competency Program</a> to help customers identify AWS Partners with deep industry experience and expertise.\n</p><p>\nValidere helps more than 40 producers, midstream, and downstream energy companies consolidate their commodity inventory data into a single repository, so they have a detailed \u201cgenealogy\u201d of every molecule as it progresses through the energy supply chain. This includes more than thirty ESG attributes such as methane intensity, carbon intensity, and recycled water use. Validere\u2019s SaaS platform, which touches over $250MM of oil and gas each day, enables energy professionals to easily access and use inventory data to improve commercial margins and reduced operational costs and risks while also tapping into new ESG opportunities.\n</p><p>\n\u201cVermilion has a strong commitment to ESG leadership, as evidenced by the recent Equitable Origin certification for three of our Canadian natural gas production sites,\u201d said Curtis Hicks, president, Vermilion. \u201cValidere has been an important partner in helping us establish an automated means to provide the data necessary for certification in a way that ensures trust through data transparency.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cWe are seeing strong demand for carbon offset credits that are generated from carbon sequestration projects,\u201d said James Graham, CEO, GuildOne, a Calgary based software company that leverages the power of advanced blockchain infrastructure and applications to build innovative digital assets and ESG solutions. \u201cCritical to our ability to list credits for purchase on our Blockchain platform is the primary data audit trail that Validere provides on sequestered carbon volumes for the purposes of validation. Validere is a key partner in enabling this new source of carbon credits.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<b>About Validere</b>\n</p><p>\nValidere is a leading data and analytics SaaS provider that is digitally transforming the world\u2019s largest supply chain to be more sustainable and efficient.
