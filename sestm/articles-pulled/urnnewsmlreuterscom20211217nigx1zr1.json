One year later, in August 2020, Future Group struck a $3.4-billion asset-sale deal with Reliance Industries (RIL).</p><p>In October this year, Amazon had sent a legal notice to Future for striking a deal with RIL. It alleged that Future\u0092s $3.4-billion asset sale deal with RIL breached an agreement with Amazon. It cited its non-compete agreement with the Kishore Biyani-led chain. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules. The same month, Amazon got a favourable ruling for its plea in SIAC against the deal.</p><p>In November 2020, Future moved the Delhi High Court (HC) against Amazon, alleging interference by the US firm in the deal with RIL. Since then, Amazon has been fighting a legal battle with FRL to stop the Kishore Biyani-led retailer's $3.4-billion deal with RIL.</p><p>In August this year, the Supreme Court (SC) had ruled in favour of Amazon, upholding the Singapore emergency arbitrator award against the Future-Reliance deal as enforceable in India. But in a major relief to Future Group, the SC stayed proceedings before Delhi HC in September this year, ordering no coercive action. The court also directed the National Company Law Tribunal, CCI, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India to not pass any final order in relation to the dispute for four weeks.</p><p>In November this year, the SC extended by two weeks the time granted to CCI by Delhi HC to take a decision with respect to the show-cause notice issued by it to Amazon over the deal with Future Group.</p><p>The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents around 70 million traders in India, said the CCI had given a landmark order and alleged that Amazon stood fully exposed for its malpractices and lies at all levels, together with continued violation of the laws and rules.</p><p>\u0093The cat has been belled at last,\u0094 CAIT National President B C Bhartia and Secretary-General Praveen Khandelwal said in a statement. They said it is a warning to not only Amazon, but to other foreign-funded e-commerce companies, to stop violating the law, rules, and foreign direct investment policy of the government.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
