These robots would have the capability to see, hear, measure, move, and act autonomously in any challenging and hazard environments. This improves the safety of facilities by ensuring reliable inspections and by capturing high quality data and processing it at the edge for faster actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaleem Al Blooshi, Chief Technology Officer, EITC, said, \"5G SA network is a key enabler to support enterprise use cases such as energy, utilities, manufacturing and agriculture. In collaboration with AWS, du can extend the compute capabilities along with IoT/AI/ML use cases to our enterprise customers premises through our fastest and most capable 5G network in the UAE. Our efforts to improve the efficiency and performance of our network have resulted in us delivering the fastest network speeds in the UAE, which is a testament to our commitment to providing the best 5G network for enterprises and consumers across UAE.\u201d</p>\n<p>Utilizing\u00a0du\u2019s\u00a05G\u00a0SA\u00a0Private Network, the demoed solution\u00a0is powered by\u00a0AWS Snowball Edge, an edge compute and storage device\u00a0with on-board S3 storage and EC2 compute for disconnected mode ruggedized environments. AWS Snowball Edge can do local\u00a0data analytics\u00a0and edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data\u00a0between local environments and AWS.\u00a0Athonet's\u00a0next generation Connectivity Platform - based on the industry-leading Private 5G\u00a0SA\u00a0Core - enables cost-effective deployment of high-performance 5G networks.</p>\n<p>The 5G SA Private Networks can power mission-critical systems and applications that require ultra-reliable (99.999%) and low latency (~ one millisecond), with very high security. du\u2019s private 5G networks can provide customers with a scalable, customizable platform to take advantage of the comprehensive set of AWS edge-to-cloud services and solutions that package IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), ML, robotics, analytics, compute, and storage capabilities to help customers achieve business outcomes across common industrial workloads.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to work with innovative companies like du and AWS to power 5G-SA private mobile solutions in the region,\u201d said Gianluca Verin, CEO of Athonet. \u201cWe enable operators like du to deploy agile private networks on customer premises that combine localized connectivity and control with access to the infinite resources and applications of AWS.\u201d</p>\n<p>-Ends-</p>\n<p><strong>About du</strong></p>\n<p><span>Operating under the steadfast umbrella of Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), du is an integral driver of the UAE\u2019s economic, social and digital transformation. Thriving on digitally innovating all facets of the contemporary telecom experience, we touch the lives of millions of customers everyday as a dedicated enabler of connectivity, continuity and growth across consumer and enterprise segments.
