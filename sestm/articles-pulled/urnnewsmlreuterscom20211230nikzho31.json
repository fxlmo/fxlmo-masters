And so, they're effectively telling him, you either go home and lose your job, or you just stay here and keep working through the pain. And that's what he did,\" Mr Thomas said in the interview.</p><p>Another worker who participated in an interview told More Perfect Union that the worker suffered a stroke and died inside a trailer. Perry Connelly, the employee who spoke with the organisation, said the man's body was not found for nearly 20 minutes.</p><p>Both workers claimed that Amazon managers told the rest of the workers to continue working and not to speak about what happened. Mr Connelly said some of the workers who interacted regularly with the individual who died were upset by the death and wanted to go home, but were not allowed.</p><p>\"There's no shutdown, there's no moment of silence, there's no time to sit and have a prayer\" Mr Connelly said. \"You're a body. Once that body's used up, they'll just bring somebody else in and do the work.\"</p><p>Workers at the warehouse attempted to unionise in April, but their efforts were ultimately defeated. Workers voted 1798 against a union against the 738 who voted for one.</p><p>The National Labour Relations Board determined that Amazon illegally interfered in the unionisation attempt by intimidating workers. A revote was ordered for 29 November, the same day that one of the individuals reportedly died at the Bessemer plant.</p><p>Workers are set to vote again for a union at the plant in 2022.</p><p>Amazon has been criticised in the past for putting workers in dangerous situation; six workers recently died after a warehouse collapsed during a tornado in Illinois.
