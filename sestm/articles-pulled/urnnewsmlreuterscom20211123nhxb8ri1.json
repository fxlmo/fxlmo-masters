Quote</a> </p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Expanding Clientele</p><p>The latest selection by adidas added strength to AWS' expanding clientele.Recently, AWS was selected by Qualtrics, the preferred cloud provider. Qualtrics is shifting its complete portfolio of experience management applications and customer-facing workloads to AWS.Additionally,<span>Under Armour</span><a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/UAA\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">UAA</a> picked AWS as the preferred cloud provider for SAP.

This, in turn, will continue to boost its cloud dominance and competitive edge against its peers like<span>Microsoft</span><a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/MSFT\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">MSFT</a> and<span>Alphabet</span>'s <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/GOOGL\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">GOOGL</a> Google.According to the latest Canalys report, AWS accounted for 32% of the global cloud spending in third-quarter 2021, sustaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft's Azure, the second-largest cloud-service provider, accounted for 21% of the worldwide cloud spending and Alphabet's Google Cloud represented 8% of the cloud spending, marking itself the third largest cloud provider.However, Amazon, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is facing stiff competition from Microsoft and Alphabet as both are targeting a bigger slice of the market on the back of their advancing cloud portfolios, which are bumping up their cloud revenues. This poses a serious challenge to Amazon's dominant position in the cloud market.Alphabet generated $4.9 billion of revenues from Google Cloud in third-quarter 2021, up 44.9% year over year.Microsoft's cloud revenues were $20.7 billion in first-quarter fiscal 2022, up 36% year over year.You can see<span><a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-list/?ADID=zp_1link_invideas&amp;ICID=zpi_1link_invideas\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</a> </span>.</p><p><span>Zacks' Top Picks to Cash in on Artificial Intelligence</span></p><p>In 2021, this world-changing technology is projected to generate $327.5 billion in revenue.
