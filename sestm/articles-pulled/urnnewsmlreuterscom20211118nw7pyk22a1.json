The AWS Global Digital Skills Study surveyed employers and workers on their perceptions of digital skills training across 12 countries. The study found that 85% of workers feel that they now need more technical knowledge to do their jobs as a result of pandemic-related changes in their work. Additionally, workers who take the time to learn new skills are seeing significant benefits, with 86% reporting greater efficiency in doing their jobs, 85% experiencing greater personal satisfaction, and 80% reporting improved employability. Employers who support workforce education programs also see benefits, with 87% reporting that investments in digital skills training have allowed their organizations to achieve their digital transformation goals more quickly and 84% noting improved worker retention.

AWS re/Start is a free, full-time, 12-week program that prepares individuals with little or no technology experience to pursue entry-level cloud computing careers. Through real-world, scenario-based exercises, labs, and coursework, students build a range of skills in a number of technology areas including Linux, Python, networking, security, and relational databases. The program connects up to 90% of graduates with job interview opportunities, and is focused on individuals from underrepresented communities, military veterans and their spouses, and those who have lost their jobs due to outdated skills.\n</p><p>\nRecent graduates of AWS re/Start, such as former cruise ship employees, fitness trainers, stay-at-home parents, and transitioning military members, have successfully used the program to step into new careers in technology. One person whose life has been positively impacted by AWS re/Start is Charlotte Wilkins, who was working at a fast-food restaurant in the UK before losing her job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWhen I got furloughed, I saw this as the right time to look at courses and find a new career,\u201d said Wilkins. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in technology and wanted to learn coding, but I wasn\u2019t sure what course to do as I didn\u2019t know the skills I would need. What I liked about AWS re/Start is that it covered a wide range of topics, skills, and cloud computing concepts. The program has really changed my life and gave me the tools I needed to start a whole new career path as an associate solutions engineer at a cloud-based company.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAWS re/Start is a springboard to help individuals start new careers, as well as provide cloud computing talent for cloud customers and partners globally.
