In August, an NLRB hearing officer said the company's conduct around the previous vote had interfered with the election.</p><p>The decision for a redo adds pressure on Amazon, which has recently faced union campaigns in New York and Canada. Worker groups view organizing the company as a landmark goal that would invigorate the U.S. labor movement.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s decision confirms what we were saying all along \u2013 that Amazon\u2019s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace,\" Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the company's employees overwhelmingly voted against joining the RWDSU this year. \"It\u2019s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn\u2019t count.\"</p><p>Amazon and the RWDSU have already restarted their campaigns in anticipation of a second election.
