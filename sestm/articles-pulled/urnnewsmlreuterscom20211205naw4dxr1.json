The artificial intelligence (AI) solution, which can be integrated into AVEVA\u2122 System Platform and Operations Management Interface and AVEVA\u2122 Insight, enables customers to use video and images from existing general-purpose cameras and convert them into user-friendly information and timely alerts.</p>\n<p>Designed for low latency industrial environments, Vision AI Assistant leverages deep learning to train and deploy 24x7 artificial intelligence models to enhance situational awareness to help operators focus on the task at hand without continuously monitoring live camera feeds.</p>\n<p>Vision AI Assistant enables organizations to improve operations, quality, and maintenance capabilities across industrial enterprises by using cameras to determine visual anomalies, assess quality, and vigorously monitor production, optimizing efficiencies and improving sustainability in the process. Product applications include:</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Standard digital cameras can be used with Vision AI Assistant to ensure quality control, such as by analyzing the quality of water treatment fluids, by gauging if a hopper is full or empty, or by identifying defective products on a production line.</li>\n<li>Vision AI Assistant can also scan thermal or infrared camera feeds so operations teams can uncover visual inconsistencies. For example, by locating compressed air or fluid leaks, it can reduce failure and efficiency loss, and by spotting hot-spots in a data center, it can prevent overheating of critical equipment.</li>\n<li>The AI solution assists maintenance efforts through continuous monitoring of plants and machinery and diagnosis of equipment issues weeks, or months before failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kenneth Labhart, Innovation Leader \u2013 Global Supply Chain North America, Schneider Electric said: \u201cAVEVA\u2019s Vision AI is monitoring and analyzing the 1.5 km main drive chain for our Lexington, Kentucky, smart factory which manufactures electric breaker panels. If that chain goes down, our entire factory comes to a halt, which typically happens a few times per year.\u00a0Vision AI has already provided early detection of issues with parts of this chain on two occasions, giving us the ability to take proactive action. By doing this, we avoid revenue-impacting, unplanned downtime.\u00a0We\u2019re looking forward to expanding our usage of this AI system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim Chappell, Global Head of AI and Advanced Analytics at\u00a0AVEVA said: \u201cThis breakthrough technology represents a game changer that transforms factory operations through the power of AI. The Vision AI Assistant enables enhanced process optimization, thereby reducing time, wastage, and costs. Cameras can also be used in areas that are not suitable for humans for security or safety concerns, freeing up workers to focus on high-value tasks instead of continuously monitoring live camera feeds.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vision AI Assistant is offered as an exclusive extension for AVEVA System Platform purchases through the AVEVA Flex subscription initiative. The flexible payment and usage program spans any mix of cloud, hybrid, and on-premises solutions across AVEVA's portfolio \u2013 enabling simple license purchasing, usage and management.</p>\n<p>-Ends-</p>\n<p><strong>About AVEVA</strong></p>\n<p><span>AVEVA is a global leader in industrial software, driving digital transformation and sustainability.
