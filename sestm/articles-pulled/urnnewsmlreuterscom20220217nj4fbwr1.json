Most of those periods came and went within a couple of years, often followed by solid rebounds.</p><p><span>To anyone holding stocks,</span> the onset of the inflationary spiral was devastating to portfolios. Investing\u00a0$10,000 entirely in a mix of stocks \u2014 from large cap growth to small cap value \u2013 in 1972\u00a0would have shrunk by $3,935,\u00a0nearly 40%, within two years, LeVitre's analysis shows.</p><p><span>Investing $10,000 entirely in a mix of bonds</span> \u2013\u00a0no stocks or cash \u2013\u00a0would have resulted in falling $1,275 behind inflation. And going entirely\u00a0to short-term instruments by buying only\u00a0Treasury bills\u00a0also came close to beating inflation.</p><p><span>Investing in a 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds,</span> however, would have provided investors with the asset mix necessary to beat inflation, LeVitre said. During the 1970s, those investors would have\u00a0managed to have come out $209 ahead.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\u00a0 Tax hacks</p><p>If you're dreading the idea of filing this year's tax return, you're probably in good company. But here are three tactics you can employ to make the process of filing your taxes easier.</p><p><span>Look at last year's tax return before you get started.</span> \u00a0Use that return to see what deductions you claimed and what information you submitted to the IRS. From there, you can make a list of the documents you'll need to complete your taxes this year.</p><p><span>File your taxes electronically.</span> \u00a0Today's software programs are set up to catch math errors and potentially flag other mistakes that could cause your return to get rejected or audited.</p><p><span>Get a second pair of eyes on your return before submitting it.\u00a0</span> This doesn't mean you have to pay a professional to help you with your taxes. Rather, enlist the help of your spouse, a family member, or a trusted friend to proofread your return before sending it in.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">\u00a0Mood music\u00a0</p><p>This week's news about Virgin Galactic fares inspired me to use the David Bowie classic \"Space Oddity.\" For here am I sitting in my tin can,\u00a0far above the world.\u00a0Planet Earth is blue\u00a0And there's nothing I can do.\" And as a bonus, here's one of his his favorite covers, performed at the International Space Station by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield.</p><p><span>LISTEN WHILE YOU WORK:</span> \u00a0 Remember, you can listen to this song and every track I've quoted in the newsletter in the Daily Money Mood Music playlist on Spotify.</p><p><span>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: The Daily Money: Amazon Prime price hike hack; history, high inflation and investing</span> </p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2022 GANNETT</p></div>"}
