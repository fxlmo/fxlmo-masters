Robot vacuums. If you've been skeptical of robot vacuums in the past, we don't blame you: When they first came out, they were expensive and\u00a0low-powered.\u00a0Now, technology has advanced to the point where these little robot helpers\u00a0can compete with the cleaning power of a traditional\u00a0upright vacuum.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p><span><span>Tackle your holiday shopping with deals and expert advice delivered straight to your phone.</span> Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting team at Reviewed.</span> </p><p>Today's robot vacuums are\u00a0efficient at fully automating the tedious task of keeping your floor clear, to the point of nearly\u00a0eliminating the need to manually vacuum.\u00a0Some, like the iRobot Roomba 692, return to their charging station on their own.
