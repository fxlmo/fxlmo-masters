Clients can easily get started with machine learning and pre-built models without the expense and time-consuming efforts of installing and purchasing platforms, assembling teams, or providing their own servers. With MLaaS available through AWS, the client's data operates directly on AWS cloud servers and MLaaS increases the efficiency and convenience of machine learning on the cloud.</p>\n<p>By using MLaaS, clients can quickly achieve many benefits to improve their operations and capabilities. Some of those benefits include:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>lower costs, as provisioning one pre-structured model can be cheaper than the annual cost of a single data scientist; </li><li>faster time-to-deployment and lower project risk, as the average deployment of a pre-built model is between 8-12 weeks for MLaaS versus 8-12 months to build new machine learning models; and </li><li>faster time-to-value with a high return on investment (ROI). </li></ul><p>One of ElectrifAi's highly successful MLaaS offerings is SpendAi, a deep spend analytics product. Now available on AWS, SpendAi can help procurement professionals quickly solve business problems with more accurate data to help eliminate cost and risk. Some of the benefits of SpendAi include: </p>\n<ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>superior visibility across multiple sources of data, </li><li>higher quality sources of spend data, </li><li>better degrees of classification, categorization and grouping, </li><li>greater flexibility, and </li><li>elimination of maverick spend. </li></ul><p>SpendAi has been proven to reduce indirect spend by 2-4% in 6-8 weeks generating substantial savings and ROI for clients.</p>\n<p>Other pre-built models offered by ElectrifAi as MLaaS include customer segmentation, product cross sell and up sell, demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, credit decisioning, computer vision and many others.</p>\n<p>\"We're pleased to introduce our MLaaS and SpendAi offerings on AWS.
