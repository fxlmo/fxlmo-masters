So I would like to stay independent,\" he added, speaking at the group's industrial headquarters and prototyping centre in Valvigna, in Tuscany.</p><p>He did not rule out acquiring other brands, saying there were no opportunities for the time being, but \"tomorrow we do not know.\"</p><p>And he dismissed, at least for the time being, the possibility of the group's main labels - Prada and the younger line Miu Miu - selling on Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>, which is seeking to lure prestigious luxury names to its platform. </p><p>\"We tried with one of our smallest brands (Car Shoe) just to have a try,\" he said. \"We don't think at the moment Amazon is ready for the bigger brands ... We don't see either Prada or Miu Miu on the Amazon platform at the moment.\"</p><p>Instead, he reiterated that Prada could be interested in taking a stake in a joint e-commerce venture that Cartier-owner Richemont <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=CFR.S\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"CFR.S\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">CFR.S</a> and U.S.-listed online retailer Farfetch <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=FTCH.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"FTCH.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FTCH.N</a> are discussing. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL8N2S3126\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL8N2S3126\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>Richemont said earlier this month it was in advanced talks with Farfetch about selling it a minority stake in its online business Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP). It added it would also invite other firms to participate in turning YNAP into an industry-wide platform with no overall controlling shareholder. </p><p>A direct investment in the platform \"could be an opportunity,\" Bertelli said.</p><p>The group last week unveiled a medium-term goal of raising its operating profit margin to 20% of sales, below that of bigger competitors like Louis Vuitton or Gucci and Prada's own profitability margin of 27% in its heyday.</p><p>Bertelli said that in the long term the group could go back to that kind of profitability level. But he said Prada preferred to give itself reasonable goals and when possible do even better, rather than aim too high and risk disappointing.</p><p>To watch the Reuters\u202fNext conference please register here <a href=\"https://reutersevents.com/events/next/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://reutersevents.com/events/next/</a></p><p>   </p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Writing by Claudia Cristoferi, editing by Silvia Aloisi and Nick Zieminski)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:silvia.aloisi@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">silvia.aloisi@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; +393487607044; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://silvia.aloisi.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">silvia.aloisi.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
