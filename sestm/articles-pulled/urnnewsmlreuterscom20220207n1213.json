At a minimum, calls for the Fed to hike at every meeting this year will look much less off-base,\" Morgan Stanley analysts including Matthew Hornbach said in a report.</p><p>The Federal Reserve said last month that it is likely to hike interest rates in March as it tackles persistent inflation, though fed funds futures traders are pricing in only a 37% chance of a 50 basis point increase that month. Five increases of 25 basis points are priced in by December. <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=FEDWATCH\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"FEDWATCH\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FEDWATCH</a>  <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2U51RB\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2U51RB\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>\u201cAn upside surprise on January US CPI next week followed by further strength in nonfarm payrolls and even more inflation in February could get expectations of a 50bp hike in March to solidify. That outcome would certainly jolt expectations for Fed policy this year - and investors aren't adequately protected against that, given current market prices, we think,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts added.</p><p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=US10YT=RR\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"US10YT=RR\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">US10YT=RR</a> jumped to two-year highs on Monday, after data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy created far more jobs than expected in January, despite the disruption to consumer-facing businesses from a surge in COVID-19 cases.
