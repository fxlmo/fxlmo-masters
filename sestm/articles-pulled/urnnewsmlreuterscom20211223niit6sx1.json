AWS will provide Repsol with new cloud services to further advance its digital transformation, and Repsol will supply renewable energy to power Amazon business operations.</p><p>As part of this collaboration, Repsol and Amazon executed power purchase agreements (PPA) to supply Amazon with renewable energy generated from 234 MW of solar and wind installed capacity in Spain. Repsol plans to continue growing its renewable business thanks to the development of a portfolio of projects in operation and development in OECD countries, being currently present in Spain, the United States, Chile, and Portugal.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>According to Mar?a Victoria Zingoni, Repsol Client and Low Carbon Energy Generation Executive Managing Director, \"this collaboration agreement with AWS shows the quality of our renewable business and adds a boost to its profitability. It represents a further step in the fulfillment of our strategy for a sustainable and efficient energy transition, committing to digitalization as an indispensable lever of transformation.\"</p><p>Howard Gefen, AWS General Manager of Energy, said: ?This collaboration will help us meet our Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030, a target we are on a path to meet 5 years early by 2025. We are excited to work with Repsol to develop new innovative cloud solutions to help them achieve their sustainability goals and accelerate their digital transformation.?</p><p>Repsol has renewable power generation as one of its decarbonization pillars and has recently updated its 2030 installed capacity targets to 20 GW, a 60% increase over the previous target. By 2025, installed capacity will increase to 6 GW, up from the 1.7 GW that Repsol expects to achieve by the year?s end.</p><p>In October, Repsol increased its ambition to invest in low-carbon projects. Between 2021 and 2025, the multi-energy company will allocate an additional ?1 billion to low-carbon projects, up to a total of ?6.5 billion, compared to the ?5.5 billion set out in the Strategic Plan approved in November 2020.
