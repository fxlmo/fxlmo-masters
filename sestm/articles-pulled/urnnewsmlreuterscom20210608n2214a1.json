The Company is therefore proposing to welcome the maximum number of shareholders in person that it is able to welcome within safety constraints and in accordance with UK Government guidelines. However, given the constantly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is pleased to be able to provide a facility for shareholders to follow the AGM remotely and to submit questions to the Board on the business of the meeting (the <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">\"Webcast\"</span>), should they wish to do so. Details of how to join the Webcast are set out in the Notice of Meeting. Viewing the AGM electronically via the Webcast will not constitute formal attendance by shareholders at the AGM and shareholders will not be able to vote via the Webcast. Should the situation change such that the Company considers that it is no longer possible for shareholders, other than the minimum required to hold a quorate meeting, to attend the AGM as intended, the Company will notify shareholders by market announcement and via the Company's website at </span><span class=\"ag\"><a href=\"https://investors.aveva.com/results-and-key-documents/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://investors.aveva.com/results-and-key-documents/</a></span><span class=\"n\">. Please ensure that you regularly check this page for updates.</span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">Shareholders intending to attend the AGM, should this be possible, are asked to register their intention as soon as practicable, and in any event by 9.00 a.m. on 5 July 2021, by emailing company.secretariat@aveva.com with the subject line \"AGM 2021\". Shareholders attending the AGM, should this be possible, will be required to comply with appropriate COVID-19 precautionary measures as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and as may be adjusted in line with UK Government guidance and communicated to shareholders who have registered their intention to attend the AGM by the deadline set out above prior to the AGM. </span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">Shareholders who are unable to attend the AGM or the Webcast can still ask questions or raise matters of concern for them as a shareholder, by emailing </span><span class=\"ag\"><a href=\"mailto:company.secretariat@aveva.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">company.secretariat@aveva.com</a></span><span class=\"am\">\u00a0</span><span class=\"n\">with the subject line \"AGM 2021\" so that it is received no later than 9.00 a.m. on 30 June 2021. The Company will endeavour to respond to such questions on the Company's website in advance of the proxy voting deadline. Shareholders joining the Webcast may also ask questions during the AGM via the Company's website.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">Given the uncertainty around whether shareholders will be able to attend the AGM in person, and because the Webcast will not provide for the ability to vote, the Company encourages all shareholders to exercise their right to vote and submit their proxy as early as possible appointing the 'Chairman of the meeting' as their proxy. This will ensure that shareholders' votes will be counted if ultimately they (or any other proxy they might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the AGM. For more information on appointing a proxy, including if you wish to appoint a proxy and for them to attend the Webcast on your behalf, please refer to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. To be valid, proxy appointments must be received by Link Group by 9.00 a.m. on 5 July 2021. </span></p>\n<p class=\"g\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">A copy of the Notice of Annual General Meeting is available to view on the Company's website at\u00a0</span><span class=\"ag\"><a href=\"https://investors.aveva.com/results-and-key-documents/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://investors.aveva.com/results-and-key-documents/</a></span><span class=\"n\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"g\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">A copy of the Notice of Annual General Meeting and a proxy form for the AGM have also been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at: </span><span class=\"ag\"><a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/W16yC799Xs9JEqpT8uS3q?domain=data.fca.org.uk\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism</a></span><span class=\"af\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"g\"><span class=\"an\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"al\"><span class=\"n\">Hard copies of the Notice of Annual General Meeting have been mailed today to those shareholders who have elected to continue to receive paper communications.
