This redefines the industrial software experience, going beyond HMI and SCADA, enabling industrial organizations of all sizes to develop collaborative workforces, scale effectively, and optimize operations for agility and efficiency.</p>\n<p>From IIoT architectures and cloud-driven remote edge management to multi-site supervisory control, AVEVA\u2122 Operations Control software will be available via a flexible user-centric model, through the AVEVA\u2122 Flex Subscription program in three core packages: Edge, Supervisory and Enterprise. These core solutions provide all the necessary tools for plant, field, control room, and enterprise teams to drive actionable information, collaborate effectively, and accelerate operational excellence. The program also offers access to add-on functionality with AVEVA Manufacturing Execution, and AVEVA Insight for advanced AI and workflow management. AVEVA\u2019s new Operations Control software subscriptions now allow end customers to use all of its products, the way they want to use them.</p>\n<p>AVEVA Operations Control offers an infinite range of possibilities for companies to connect operations and workers via the cloud, web and mobile to drive efficiency through collaboration and standardization. It delivers supervisory, visualization, collaboration, and analytics software in a single combined subscription providing unlimited access to actionable information.\u00a0 Every team, whether on the plant floor, in the control room, or operating across the enterprise, is empowered to do more, in collaborative alignment. Customers can build a reliable foundation towards operational excellence with AVEVA Operations Control.</p>\n<p>AVEVA offers the first single subscription program on that market that spans edge-to-cloud solutions for plant operations. The AVEVA Flex subscription program is designed to provide access to the entire AVEVA portfolio \u2013 enabling customers to flexibly drive sustainable growth. It allows companies to achieve a faster return-on-investment, removing traditional barriers to software adoption and revolutionizing the purchase and consumption of industrial software. The subscription model enables simplicity in license purchasing, usage and management \u2013\u00a0aiding organizational digital transformation.</p>\n<p>In the FY21 fiscal year, AVEVA recorded strong subscriptions growth as businesses sought access to transformational technology on a flexible, agile basis. According to ARC Advisory Group, subscription-based models are predicted to grow at a pace nearly four times that of traditional software over the next five years in the industrial automation markets.</p>\n<p>Craig Resnick, Vice President at ARC Advisory Group commented: \u201cARC anticipates that the subscription model growth rate will be significantly higher than the traditional licensing model growth rate for purchasing HMI/SCADA solutions going forward. This shift towards the subscription model is driven by a number of factors, including the market seeking single converged solutions, such as HMI/SCADA and asset performance management, that deliver great flexibility together with edge-to-cloud integration, a capability that AVEVA can deliver today as part of its AVEVA Flex subscription program.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rashesh Mody, SVP Monitoring and Control, AVEVA said: \u201cOur solution is enabling teams in different physical locations to organize their operations, collaborate, and leverage vast internal knowledge. Most importantly, customers can now accelerate their digital transformation journey through one simple, agnostic subscription package.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Industrial organizations are increasingly aiming to utilize technology environments that will provide them with a comprehensive view of their field, control room and enterprise operational facilities. With AVEVA Operations Control they can now view end-to-end processes with an unlimited offering through the edge, enterprise and supervisory core functions,\u201d Mody added.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>\"With AVEVA Operations Control available via the AVEVA Flex subscription program, channel partners can now offer outcome-based solutions and services to their customers.
