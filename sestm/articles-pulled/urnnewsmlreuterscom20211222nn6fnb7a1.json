Just as Korean consumers went crazy for American products that featured in <span class=\"xn-location\">Hollywood</span> movies in the past, entertainment has a way of increasing the overall value of a brand of its respective nation.</p>\n<p>One Korean beauty brand in particular is taking advantage of this trend with their line of kids' beauty products.</p>\n<p><span id=\"spanHghlt9eb3\">\"I'm</span> NOT A Baby<span id=\"spanHghltc1f4\">\",</span> first established by a mother for her child, is a top-notch kids' beauty brand which boasts the motto, 'Great Ingredients, Great Products'.

Developed especially for kids' skin care, their products have been recognized as safe to use by Korean consumers, and are seeing rapid growth every year as a leading brand in the kids' beauty industry. Their products have recently been flying off the shelves after a live collaboration broadcast on YouTube with a prominent influencer.</p>\n<p>It's also worth mentioning that marketing and promotion through social media played a big part in their meteoric rise. Many buyers turned their heads towards the brand after they featured in the <span id=\"spanHghlt0471\">\"Beyond</span> K-Lifestyle at American <span id=\"spanHghlt31c6\">Dream\"</span> exhibition in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York</span>, which was hosted from <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 5th to 7th</span>. They have also completed their registration process with Amazon Europe, with plans to dive into the European market as soon as they acquire the Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) certification.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, they have kept themselves busy by featuring their brand in a variety of international exhibitions, such as <span id=\"spanHghlt5516\">\"Cosmobeauty</span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Seoul</span> <span id=\"spanHghlt4209\">2021\"</span> in COEX (<span class=\"xn-location\">Seoul</span>) back in July, <span id=\"spanHghltaf89\">\"K</span>-Lifestyle in <span class=\"xn-location\">Middle East</span> <span id=\"spanHghlt4f7c\">2021\"</span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Dubai</span> back in October, and <span id=\"spanHghltda09\">\"Comoprof</span> Asia Digital Week <span id=\"spanHghlt7d9d\">2021\"</span> back in November, closing deals with a multitude of buyers and commencing exporting operations, starting their new era of competing in the overseas market.
