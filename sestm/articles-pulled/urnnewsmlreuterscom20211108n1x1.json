We drew a combined total of 800 player registrations and crowned winners in four different tournaments this weekend!</p><p>With over a dozen more events planned in November, we expect our tournament division will continue to post impressive numbers monthly - and, having just added a new salesperson to our team, those metrics should help him hit the ground running as we move to expand the Company's revenue base. This weekend's Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links event drew nearly 400 registrations and brought countless memorable moments with nonstop action throughout the day! When the dust settled, a sizable number of the Top 64 decks seemed to fall in line with expectations of the current meta, with Harpies being well represented, along with Melodious, Magnets, Water Xyz, Yosenju, Gaia, and the winner of the last GGToor x DLE: Destiny HERO.\u00a0</p><p>Some rogue decks also made it into the Top Cut! The stream and viewers alike rooted for a defeat of the infamous Darklords archetype, but that was not enough to stop the deck from making it into the Top 16. Blue-Eyes, another deck that was extremely strong in prior metas, climbed to Top 4 before being defeated. D/D/D, the new deck that were optimistic but had no results in our last event, had a respectable showing and made it into the Top 8. In the end, Mihawk won it all with Destiny HERO, setting a new record as it became the first deck to win two GGToor x DLE tournaments in a row!</p><p>Also, at this weekend's Minion Masters Knights Duel tournament we saw both Coax the Diplomancer and Hypnotise banned, causing some players to rethink their strategies coming into the event. One of the most memorable events in the early rounds was when we saw Lazur get just what he needed from Apep's Perk 3 - a free Ghost that did work against Nataraja\u2019s Fanriel Mordar build! Throughout the event, SeT dominated with R3-KT, which caused a vast majority of players to ban the master. With R3-KT taken off the table, SeT began to dominate with his Diona + Brother of the Burning Fist deck, playing it frequently throughout the event.\u00a0</p><p>Much like Lazur, lady luck smiled upon SeT\u2019s Apep in the Winner's bracket finals as well, with Perk 3 giving him a Chisma Boomstick, absolutely demolishing DeathShoott\u2019s tiny King Puff build. Undeterred, DeathShoott came back and secured his spot in the Grand Final when his Rock Rivals Volco deck proved to be a perfect counter to SeT\u2019s Morellia / Wrekinator deck. In the Redemption Bracket Final, SeT bested Lazur and force a rematch against DeathShoott in the Grand Finals. SeT was able to score wins with his Diona and Apep decks, but fell short against Deathshoot, unable to find a third deck able to take a win and close out the match in the Best-of-5 Grand finals. Congrats to Deathshoott, adding another GGToor championship to his resume!</p><p>In the beginning, before Covid, our company was getting ready to find a place to build the Sport Venues dream that John Whitman, our CEO envisioned. A complex of different venues to accommodate the ever-growing youth sports craze in the US and the world. A place where sports leagues can travel and compete in a safe place. In this place, you were going to find Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball, and many popular sports venues along with hotels and entertainment.</p><p>But as you all know the world changed in an instant, no more in-person anything, no games, and no gatherings of any kind. Then, in a stroke of genius, John called and asked me what I thought of eSports and I replied, \u201cgreat idea is perfect\u201d and went on to explain his vision. Shadow Gaming was launched officially in April 2020 since then we have built a virtual platform for event competitions. With a small crew and a lot of passion, we went along with John\u2019s new direction carving a niche in the eSports industry. We jumped with both feet, always believing this was the right move. Management has spent a lot of time learning and creating the plan that will take the Company to the next level.</p><p>Now that we are close to the end of 2021, we have had tremendous growth in the last year and a half. I can say all the arduous work and sacrifice is paying off. With over 120 events this year alone, 29,899 registered players, 14,175 Discord users, and 127,531 Twitch unique viewers. You can buy GGToor merchandise, earn credits, be a Tournament Organizer and participate in our events all from one place. In 2022 we are looking to expand to in-person venues, our cryptocurrency \u201cGGcoin\u201d and grow our business by increasing our events, participant registrations thus growing our database.\u00a0</p><p><b>GGToor Portal and what it does</b></p><p>GGToor, portal was planned to offer gamers a complete platform with all necessary tools to compete, enjoy, and make it the preferred platform to meet and play with more people around the world.</p><p>\u00a0What the Company\u2019s GGToor Portal offers:</p><p><b>\u00a0GAMERS</b></p><p>Profile Creation: They can provide very basic information enough to us to keep a reliable communication, and include an avatar as the main image, and also show themselves to the world with their gamer\u2019s name (fantasy name), or they can fill this up too with very extensive information that allows them to share all social media and other gaming platforms as well.

This is a very exclusive area, only allowed for the administrators, and creators of the events. The platform allows the organizer to manage his profile, not for public exhibition, but extremely important for GGToor for reliable communication and certification about the integrity and quality of the administrator.</p><p>The organizer can check their old events, and control or make new ones.</p><p>Each Event module, as an independent element, gets the organizers all necessary tools for the tournament. Initially, he must create the event, then, he can select the game from a vast list of games, name the event, date, how many players, time, format, write down the rules, details, schedule, contact, etc.</p><p>One of the tabs, called \"Banner\", will provide a generic banner for promotions and a banner creation tool just in case you want to create your own banner style, or just load your banner created from another software like photoshop.</p><p>The registration time and expiration could be adjusted manually or automatically, so the system will assist you at closing times.</p><p>The Structure tab allows you to create tournaments with all quantity of stages you want and mix all types of systems like \u201cSwiss System,\u201d \u201cSingle Elimination,\u201d \u201cDouble Elimination,\u201d \u201cBracket Groups\u201d, and others.

The system provides a chat one-one, direct email, and manipulation of all data, names, or avatars of players, and teams, to avoid non-legal, or offensive images to morality, showing around the event.</p><p>The main operation tab helps the organizer to delete the event or duplicate the event to easily make a similar event at any time. As well as a button to \u201cContact Us\u201d that goes directly to our IT Department and receives assistance over a bug or issue discovered in the \u201cOrganizer\u201d area.</p><p>Finally, a tab for \u201cClose the Tournament,\u201d where at the end of the event, the organizer upload or create a memorial banner, and insert the ranking position and names of the winners of the event.</p><p>In the event, after all players were seeded, and time for registration was up, the system opens a window for \u201ctournament Controller.\u201d In this window the organizer sends to ARENA of the players the order to execute a match \u2013 The players, after finishing the competition, inside the ARENA fill out a report of the match including a screenshot of the results \u2013 then the organizer checks the information, and he approves the match results.
