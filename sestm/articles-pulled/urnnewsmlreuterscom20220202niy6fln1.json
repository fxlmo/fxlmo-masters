The plea was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. \"List next Tuesday,\" the CJI replied. In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended the clearance for the 2019 deal between the two firms, stating that Amazon failed to notify it about certain crucial details of its acquisition. Based on the CCI order, Future Group moved the Delhi HC seeking stay on the arbitration proceedings before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)'s Delhi-seated tribunal. While Future's plea was rejected by a single-judge bench, a division bench on January 5 stayed the proceedings before the tribunal.
