U.S. order growth across November is flat and consumers are purchasing 1% fewer items per transaction,\" Garf said.</p><p>The start of the holiday season sales also comes when the new Omicron coronavirus variant has triggered uncertainty over the economic recovery, causing a selloff in the U.S. stock markets on Black Friday. <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=.N\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\".N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">.N</a></p><p>A senior Amazon.com Inc <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> executive has said it remains too early to predict how the variant will impact consumer spending during the holiday season but suggested that shoppers will press ahead for now. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2SJ0H7\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2SJ0H7\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:UdaySampath.Kumar@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">UdaySampath.Kumar@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sampath_uday\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://twitter.com/sampath_uday</a> ;))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
