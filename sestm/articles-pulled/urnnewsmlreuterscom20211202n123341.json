Blue aims to launch the spacecraft in the second half of this decade.</p><p>Blue Origin sees Orbital Reef as a hub for commercial industries such as manufacturing, entertainment, sports, gaming and adventure travel. It's also aimed to be a home for crewed and cargo missions by Boeing's Starliner capsule and Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spaceplane.</p><p>\"No one knows how commercial LEO markets will develop, but we intend to find out,\" Brent Sherwood, senior vice president of advanced development programs for Blue Origin, said in a statement.</p><p>Houston-based Nanoracks won the largest award, at $160 million, for the Starlab space station it is building with Lockheed Martin Corp <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=LMT.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"LMT.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">LMT.N</a> and Voyager Space.
