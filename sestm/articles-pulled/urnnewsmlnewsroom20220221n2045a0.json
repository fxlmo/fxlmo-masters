With more than 350 customers and over 85,000 connected devices across the United States and territories, the company serves a customer base spanning defence, government, manufacturing, telecommunications, utilities, real estate, and education with a wide range of use cases from network densification and mobile offload to private wireless and industrial IoT. Noteworthy customers include Charter, Comcast, the US Department of Defense, Carnegie Mellon University, and others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Accelerating private 5G wireless for enterprise</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Critical to the Federated strategy is expanding its edge solutions, which it will achieve through collaboration with hyperscale providers including AWS, Intel, HPE-Aruba, JMA, Cisco, and others. The company's top priorities include:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Investing in cloud-native tools to empower edge innovation, including automation, application analytics and zero touch provisioning (ZTP);</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Mobilising the ecosystem with a heightened focus on relationship management, business development and sales enablement;</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Expanding product capabilities for sharing in 6 Ghz, and promoting its adoption domestically and internationally; and</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Ramping up commercial capacity with increased investment in Sales, Marketing and Customer Success.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Investing in growth</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In addition to significant investments in product development, Federated has made key appointments to the company's leadership team and Board:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Dr. Shaygan Kheradpir joins the Federated Wireless Board, bringing senior C-level experience from industry giants such as Verizon, Barclays, Juniper, and Coriant, where he served as CEO and Chairman</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Industry veteran Chris Swan joins as Chief Commercial Officer to drive record growth with leadership over sales, marketing, and customer care</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00b7</span>\n<span>Strategic operations and finance executive Loren Buck joins as Chief Financial Officer, accountable for capital raising, strategic investments, financial planning and cash management</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Outlook</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Federated delivered a year of very strong revenue growth in 2021, albeit below the expectations set out at Allied Minds' capital markets presentation in April 2021. This was due to delayed customer deployment of contracted business that was originally budgeted for the final months of the year. It is anticipated that revenue recognition will occur in 2022.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Board remains very positive about Federated's growth prospects and potential for further valuation upside. It is pleased that investors with Cerberus and GIC's track record also recognise that opportunity with their respective investments.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Further information about the Series D funding</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Series D funding was completed at a post</span>\n<span>\u2010</span>\n<span>money valuation of $288 million, up from the Series C post-money valuation of $215 million published in the Allied Minds' Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2020.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In November 2021, Allied Minds invested $4,283,000 in Federated as bridge financing, which has been fully converted following the completion of the Series D funding round.
