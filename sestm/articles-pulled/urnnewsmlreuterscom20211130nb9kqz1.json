This combined offering makes it easier and faster for companies and end customers to connect products such as industrial sensors, home appliances, irrigation systems and medical devices to Amazon Web Services (AWS). It also enables developers who are implementing first-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications to offload the complex, undifferentiated work required to securely connect devices to AWS. This allows developers to focus on their core competencies of building new and innovative products, while reducing design efforts and accelerating time-to-market. The CCM solution is pre-certified with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          \"Traditionally, connecting devices to the cloud has been a difficult and time-consuming process that requires developers to possess a wide range of technical competencies in Wi-Fi, embedded systems, antenna design and cloud configuration along while creating complex code,\" said Rob Conant, Vice President of Software and Ecosystem at Infineon. \"With this new plug-and-play solution, engineers can easily, quickly and securely connect devices at scale to AWS. We are excited to continue our work with AWS to help engineers focus on building products that get to market faster and to create new revenue streams.\"\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <strong>Key benefits of the AIROC Cloud Connectivity Manager:</strong>\n                  </p>\n                  <ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n                    <li>\n            Allows developers to use simple configuration commands such as \"connect\" and \"send\" to establish a connection and start streaming data to AWS within hours, not weeks\n          </li>\n                    <li>\n            Enables original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to easily transform products into IoT devices without merging large amounts of code, or have a deep understanding of the implementation\n          </li>\n                    <li>\n            Offers the flexibility to connect various devices to AWS, while preserving the original application software and avoiding costly redesign\n          </li>\n                    <li>\n            Software upgradable via over-the-air (OTA) upgrades with the CCM solution along with support for host OTA upgrades to ensure security and future proofing\n          </li>\n                    <li>\n            Maintains fleet security and health at scale by providing an out-of-the-box solution that securely transmits data to and from the cloud via Wi-Fi\n          </li>\n                    <li>\n            CCM includes support for the CIRRENT\u2122 Cloud ID, which ensures that each device has a unique device identity and assignment to a product company stored in a secure hardware element to ensure a fail-proof mechanism.\n          </li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <p>\n          \"The combination of Infineon's CCM and our AWS IoT ExpressLink solution gives IoT developers an easy hardware solution to securely connect their products to the cloud,\" said Yasser Alsaied, Vice President of IoT at AWS. \"This collaboration helps developers bring smarter, secure IoT devices to market.
