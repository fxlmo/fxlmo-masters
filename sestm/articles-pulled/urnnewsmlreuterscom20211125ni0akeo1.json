Garu Zenzile Khoisan, leader of the Western Cape First Nations Collective, a group in favour of the development, said: \"The collective remains resolute and undeterred by the actions and antics of the Observatory elite and the fifth columns and mercenaries who are allied with their lost cause.</p><p>\"We maintain our position that we are the structures and leaders that have led the Khoi and San resurgence from its inception.</p><p>\"We have secured our right of return to the land from which our ancestors were unjustly removed by the ancestors of the Observatory elite that want to usurp our voice.\"</p><p>mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za</p><p><a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/capeargus\"><span>Cape Argus</span> </a> </p><p>Cape Argus \u00a9 1999 - 2021 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.
