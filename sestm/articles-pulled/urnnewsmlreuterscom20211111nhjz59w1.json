If John Harbaugh's team just plays its own game and doesn't turn the ball over, it will come out with a victory. The Dolphins will need to commit an extra defender to keep QB Lamar Jackson in the pocket and minimize his effect on the ground.</p><p>Dolphins' keys: They might be without starting QB Tua Tagovailoa for the second week in a row as he deals with a fracture on the ring finger on his throwing hand. Miami will need to focus all of its efforts to be great on defense for a third game in a row.</p><p>\u2013 Mike Masala, Dolphins Wire</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Gannett</p></div>"}
