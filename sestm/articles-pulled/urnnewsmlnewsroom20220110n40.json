A higher, steeper yield curve triggered by the Friday\n  payrolls release continues to exert influence over stock traders - who are\n  positioning for higher inflation and tighter Fed policy. Friday's NFP added\n  to the rationale for this trade, pointing to a tightening labor market via\n  faster earnings and lower unemployment.\n* The NASDAQ underperformed notably, with tech and growth sectors the names to\n  watch. The likes of Tesla, Etsy, Amazon and Alphabet all traded sharply\n  lower, and a midday recovery failed to tip headline indices back into the\n  green.\n* The slide in the e-mini S&amp;P puts the index within range of the 100-dma\n  support at 4559.9, a break through which would put prices through the bull\n  trend channel posted off the early October lows.\n* Moves come ahead of the unofficial beginning of Q1 earnings season, as\n  JPMorgan, BlackRock, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all report on Friday.</pre>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Thomson Reuters Limited.</p></div>"}
