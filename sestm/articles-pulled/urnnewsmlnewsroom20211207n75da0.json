The Metaverse\nopportunity is new, exciting and huge to most companies, but we have been\nworking on it for the past few years which gives us what I believe is a\nhead start. We are starting to see business momentum in our 3D and AR\nproduct offerings as more and more brands and companies are beginning to\nrecognize this massive opportunity. Just recently, companies like Facebook,\nEpic Games, Microsoft, Unity, Nike, Adidas, Budweiser, and more have all\njoined the Metaverse revolution and are looking to companies like Nextech\nand others to provide 3D and AR solutions. As we continue to innovate and\nroll out new product offerings that fit into the Metaverse narrative I'm\nvery optimistic about our growth in 2022 and beyond. I'm investing today\nbecause I see many years of strong forward growth ahead, primarily in our\nexpansive ARitize technology stack, which includes; ARitize Metaverse\nStudio, ARitize 3D, ARitize Ads, ARitize CAD, ARitize Decorator, ARitize\nHolograms, ARitize CPG, ARitize labs, ARitize University, ARitize Event 3D,\nARitize Portals, ARitize Concerts, ARitize Capture, ARitize Play\".\n\n    Earn-out payment in shares:\n\n    Payment of the earn-out related to the Map Dynamics assets acquisition\ndisclosed and announced on November 23, 2020 was settled as per the initial\nagreement terms for 193,789 common shares issued at a deemed price per\nshare of $1.57 CAD and $15,000 USD in cash paid to the owners of the\nvendor.\n\n    On behalf of the Board of Nextech AR Solutions Corp.Evan GappelbergCEO\nand Director\n\n    To learn more, please follow us on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram,\nLinkedIn, and Facebook, or visit our website: <a href=\"https://www.Nextechar.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.Nextechar.com</a>.\n\n    About Nextech AR\n\n    Nextech AR Solutions is a Metaverse company that develops and operates\naugmented reality (\"AR\") platforms, transporting three-dimensional (\"3D\")\nproduct visualizations, human holograms and 360 portals to its audiences\naltering e-commerce, digital advertising, hybrid virtual events (events\nheld in a digital format blended with in-person attendance) and learning\nand training experiences.\n\n    Nextech focuses on developing AR solutions for the Metaverse, however\nmost of the Company's revenues are derived from three e-Commerce platforms:\nvacuumcleanermarket.com (\"VCM\"), infinitepetlife.com (\"IPL\") and\nTrulyfesupplements.com (\"TruLyfe\").
