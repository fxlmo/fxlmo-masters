Despite a solid session on Friday, with tech names (and\n  notably the NASDAQ) rallying, markets were unable to climb above last\n  Friday's close, leaving indices lower for fourth consecutive week.\n* Friday's recovery was led by the likes of Apple, Visa and Mastercard, who all\n  rallied 5% on more on a solid set of earnings, helping the tech sector to the\n  top of the S&amp;P 500.\n* Energy names were the laggard despite still-buoyant crude prices as Chevron's\n  earnings missed forecast - with profits and revenues failing to keep up with\n  oil price rally.\n* Earnings season continues in the coming week, with a further 28% of the\n  S&amp;P500 due to report, including megacap names Meta (Facebook), Amazon and\n  Alphabet.
