By running MATRIXX on AWS Outposts, global communications service providers (CSPs) gain an industry-leading edge cloud monetization solution that delivers the cost savings and scalability of public cloud as well as the privacy and performance of on-premises deployments. The joint solution, currently being deployed at a multinational carrier, has a proven ability to power diverse monetization needs, including 4G/5G/fixed monetization of consumer and enterprise services.\n</p><p>\n\u201cTelcos are rapidly adopting public cloud and seeking solutions best suited for modern business,\u201d said Marc Price, chief technology officer at MATRIXX Software. \u201cHybrid and edge-based cloud solutions are often the best choice, harnessing cloud scalability without compromising on privacy and speed. Leveraging MATRIXX on AWS Outposts, operators gain the benefits of a truly modern monetization solution to unlock performance and cost advantages for new product and service offerings.\u201d\n</p><p>\nBy extending existing capabilities of MATRIXX on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), MATRIXX now runs on AWS Outposts, a fully managed solution delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience. MATRIXX on AWS Outposts offers a new way for CSPs to get the benefits of MATRIXX\u2019s high-performance, low-latency monetization capabilities based on their hybrid and edge cloud requirements.
