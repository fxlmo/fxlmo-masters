(AWS) Service Ready Program. This designation recognizes that Aqua Security\u2019s Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) has demonstrated successful integration with the AWS Graviton service.\n</p><p>\nAqua\u2019s platform solves the security and compliance challenges of cloud native environments with purpose-built runtime controls based on container behavioral profiling. This allows Aqua Security to prevent specific executables and protects against unauthorized network connections to further secure and address compliance requirements for workloads running on AWS Graviton2 instances.\n</p><p>\nAchieving the AWS Graviton Ready designation differentiates Aqua Security as an AWS Partner Network (APN) member with a product integrating with AWS Graviton and is generally available and fully supported for AWS customers. AWS Service Ready Partners have demonstrated success building products integrated with AWS services, helping AWS customers evaluate and use their technology productively, at scale, and with varying levels of complexity.\n</p><p>\n\u201cAchieving the AWS Graviton Ready designation demonstrates how Aqua Security is continuously innovating its solutions to meet the security needs of organizations across the world,\u201d said Amir Jerbi, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer at Aqua Security. \u201cAutomating compliance is a significant challenge when adopting new services. As an AWS partner, we are focused on removing that barrier and unlocking the value that AWS services provide through seamless integration of advanced cloud native security.\u201d\n</p><p>\nTo support the seamless integration and deployment of these solutions, AWS established the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fpartners%2Fservice-ready%2F&amp;esheet=52538817&amp;newsitemid=20211129005029&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=AWS+Service+Ready+Program&amp;index=2&amp;md5=9af9989c4f3ae3ebd3156d7bb7a6e7ee\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Service Ready Program</a> to help customers identify solutions integrated with AWS services and spend less time evaluating new tools, and more time scaling their use of solutions that are integrated with AWS.\n</p><p>\nAqua Security is the pioneer in securing cloud native environments and is the industry\u2019s gold standard for CNAPP, offering an integrated platform that embeds controls early in development and seamlessly bakes them in all the way into production, protecting applications wherever they\u2019re deployed.
