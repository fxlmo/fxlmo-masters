Ltd have also urged the high court to set aside the SIAC order.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>Last week, SIAC dismissed Future group's appeal to vacate the interim stay on the Reliance transaction awarded in October 2020. In its appeal, the company contested the observation of the arbitration court, saying that Future Retail was in no way a party to the agreement between Amazon and Future Coupons, as the group promoters had not signed any agreement with Amazon.</p><p>Amazon invested Rs.1,400 crore in Future Coupons, which owns nearly 10% stake in Future Retail.</p><p>In its appeal on Tuesday, Future Retail has also urged the court to allow the company to conduct a meeting of shareholders and creditors, according to an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).</p><p>On September 28, the NCLT had allowed the Kishore Biyani-led group companies to hold meetings of shareholders and creditors for approval to sell all its assets to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.</p><p>Last week, Amazon filed an interim application in the Supreme Court to restrain Future Retail from holding the meeting of shareholders and creditors on the Reliance Retail deal.</p><p>On 29 August 2020, the debt-laden Future Group announced the sale of its retail and wholesale assets to RIL's subsidiaries for Rs.24,713 crore. Soon after, Amazon approached SIAC on the grounds that its investment agreement with Future Coupons, another Biyani firm, bars Future Retail from selling its assets to Reliance.</p><p>A SIAC emergency order stayed the sale process, triggering a court battle between Amazon and Future over the legality to enforce the SIAC order.</p><p>Subsequently, the Singapore tribunal has heard both parties, and a final order is expected soon.</p><p>In August, the apex court had upheld the Singapore emergency arbitrator's order suspending the Mukesh Ambani-led RIL's acquisition of Future Group's retail assets.
