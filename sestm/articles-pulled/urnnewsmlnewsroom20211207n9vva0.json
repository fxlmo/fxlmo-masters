Vayyar Care detects falls in all lighting conditions, including pitch darkness, and even dense steam, making it ideal for use in bathrooms where 80% of falls happen[1] and where customers may not want to have cameras.</p>\n<p>After a fall, standard buttons and cords are often out of reach and even wearables cannot guarantee round-the-clock protection: a third of seniors forget to put on their devices, while a fifth refuse to use them[2], fearing loss of independence.</p>\n<p>In fact, over 90% of seniors now prefer to continue to live independently rather than move into an assisted living community[3].</p>\n<p>\"We designed Alexa Together to help aging customers feel more comfortable and confident living independently,\" said <span>Nicolas Maynard</span> , Senior Manager, Amazon Alexa. \"Alexa Together offers even more value for aging customers when they can connect a device like Vayyar Care. We're excited to team up with Vayyar Imaging to help give our customers added peace of mind.</p>\n<p>When the Vayyar Care device detects a fall, it will send a signal to Alexa to ask if the customer wants to call the Alexa Together Urgent Response emergency helpline. Alexa will also send a notification to the aging loved one's caregiver.</p>\n<p>\"With today's seniors more empowered and engaged than ever, there's a clear need for smart technologies that enable them to maintain their lifestyles, providing the protection they demand and the peace-of-mind their families expect,\" said <span>Raviv Melamed</span> , Vayyar Co-founder and CEO. \"That's exactly where Vayyar Care comes in, and I'm delighted that we're able to play a pivotal role in Amazon's new Alexa Together service.\"</p>\n<p>Vayyar Care builds on the global success of the company's B2B platform, which provides real-time fall detection and supports advanced activity analytics for senior living communities in the U.S., EU, <span>China</span> , <span>Australia</span> , and beyond.</p>\n<p>The multifunctional sensing technology relies on low-power radio frequency waves, providing a safe, robust, and reliable solution for elderly people who want 24/7 protection without compromising their privacy or independence.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VAYYAR-Care-Touchless-Compatible-Detection/dp/B09JXV82Z6/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=vayyar+care&amp;qid=1637767926&amp;sr=8-2\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Vayyar Care is available now from amazon.com</a> .</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://vayyar.com/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://vayyar.com/</a>\n</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.thepattersonfoundation.org/blog/aging-in-the-right-place-follow-these-easy-steps-to-make-your-bathroom-safer.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Aging in the Right Place: Follow These Easy Steps to Make Your Bathroom Safer</a> [2] <a href=\"https://livius.com.au/news/pilot-study-3-of-3\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Pilot Study on Older Australians - Quality of Life (Part 3 of 3)</a> [3] <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/10/2226492/0/en/NEARLY-90-OF-AMERICANS-AGE-50-AND-OLDER-WANT-TO-AGE-IN-PLACE.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Nearly 90% Of Americans Aged 50 and Older Want to \"Age in Place\"</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p>View original content to download multimedia: <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vayyar-to-provide-fall-detection-powered-by-touchless-technology-compatible-with-new-amazon-alexa-together-service-301439082.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vayyar-to-provide-fall-detection-powered-by-touchless-technology-compatible-with-new-amazon-alexa-together-service-301439082.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>SOURCE Vayyar</p>\n<p>View original content to download multimedia: <a href=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2021/07/c0205.html\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2021/07/c0205.html</a>\n</p>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 CNW Group Ltd.</p></div>"}
