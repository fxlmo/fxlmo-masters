(\"Lucira Health\" or \"Lucira\") (Nasdaq: LHDX), a medical technology company focusing on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits, announced more than two million Lucira<sup><span>\u2122</span></sup> Check-It COVID-19 tests, a rapid at-home test with PCR-quality accuracy, are available on <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3432942-1&amp;h=3369118924&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLucira-COVID-19-Single-use-Quality-Molecular%2Fdp%2FB092KGQT2Y%2F%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26pd_rd_w%3DbZYnH%26pf_rd_p%3D29505bbf-38bd-47ef-8224-a5dd0cda2bae%26pf_rd_r%3D5CTWH08ZXC0PKD8ENWPB%26pd_rd_r%3D9e9845b9-9537-40c2-981e-c77bf21e8bdb%26pd_rd_wg%3DmCq8U%26ref_%3Dpd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&amp;a=Amazon.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Amazon.com</a>.

Lucira's innovative tests uniquely combine the speed and at-home usability of rapid antigen tests and the accuracy and early detection of PCR. Lucira's tests are amplification tests, meaning they amplify virus genetic material, just like PCR tests, but are miniaturized to fit in the palm of your hand and were shown to be 98% accurate in a head-to-head comparison to one of the most sensitive lab-based PCR tests. Results are available in 30 minutes and the test works in three easy steps with no prescription required. At <span class=\"xn-money\">$75</span>, the Check-It COVID-19 test kit is priced less than most lab-based PCR tests and mail-in PCR kits, both of which can take up to 2-4 days to receive results. Lucira Check-It tests are also eligible for the recently announced at-home test reimbursement from private insurers.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>\"We have worked tirelessly to ensure Lucira Check-It COVID-19 tests are more accessible to the public,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Erik Engelson</span>, Lucira Health's Chief Executive Officer. \"Access to a COVID-19 test with PCR-level accuracy and early detectability, previously only available from a lab test, in 30 minutes without leaving your home can help Americans confidently return to work or school and get back to gathering in-person with family and friends. Amazon's distribution network enables more people in <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States</span> to access this innovative and unique testing solution.\"</p>\n<p>The test kit, the first and only single-use at-home amplification test authorized for emergency use by FDA, is available over the counter (\"OTC\") and can produce a positive result in as little as 11 minutes, or a negative result within 30 minutes. Immediately after testing, users can access a free, text-based digital\u00a0LUCI PASS\u2122\u00a0verified test result on their phone.</p>\n<p>The Check-It COVID-19 test kit costs <span class=\"xn-money\">$75</span> for a single test. The list price is <span class=\"xn-money\">$89</span> with a <span class=\"xn-money\">$14</span> coupon available on amazon.com. Tests are also available on <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3432942-1&amp;h=16811694&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lucirahealth.com%2F&amp;a=www.lucirahealth.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.lucirahealth.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The Lucira Check-It COVID-19 test kit has emergency authorization by FDA under EUA.</p>\n<p><b><span>LUCIRA\u2122 Check-It Test Kit</span></b></p>\n<p>The Lucira\u2122 Check-It (OTC) test is a Nucleic-Acid Amplification Tests (referred to as NAAT). The test fits in the palm of your hand, extracts genetic material from the virus and amplifies it, similar to PCR lab tests, to detect the presence of virus earlier and more accurately than antigen tests. The test uses an approach called reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). It was designed and tested extensively for individuals to use independently and does not require a physician's prescription or supervised assistance. There is no additional equipment to purchase, such as a reader or instrument.</p>\n<p>In a community trial setting, Lucira\u2122 Check-It results were compared with the Hologic Panther Fusion, which is considered a high-sensitivity molecular test due to its low Limit of Detection (\"LOD\"). Lucira's accuracy was 98%, correctly detecting 385 out of 394 positive and negative samples in comparison to the Hologic Panther Fusion, excluding ten samples with very low levels of virus (those with very high PCR cycle thresholds of 37.5 or greater) that likely no longer represented active infection. Comparative positive results agreed 97% of the time among this sample, and negative results agreed 98% of the time.</p>\n<p>Lucira has announced confirmation that its COVID-19 Check-It molecular self-test kits can detect 100% of Omicron variant genome sequences analyzed, including sub-variant BA.2, as of <span class=\"xn-chron\">January 11, 2022</span>. Lucira assays target viral sequence regions unaffected by the spike protein mutations found in Omicron, Delta and other Variants of Concern, allowing it to maintain its accuracy in the face of an evolving virus.</p>\n<p>Each Lucira test kit contains everything needed to run a single COVID-19 test. Users get the test device, two AA batteries, sample vial, swab, and simple instructions. The batteries are inserted into the device and the sample vial is placed in the test unit. The user then opens the test swab packet and rotates the swab five times in each nostril. The swab is then stirred in the sample vial, which is then gently pressed into the test unit to start the test. The \"ready\" light will blink until a \"positive\" or \"negative\" green light is illuminated within 30 minutes. In the US, Lucira also offers a free LUCI Pass\u2122 digital verified test result back to a user's phone. LUCI Pass is accessed via text and does not require downloading an app. There is also an opt-in for public health reporting for users who wish to transmit their results to the relevant public health authorities.</p>\n<p>In clinical trials, 100% of users successfully performed the test at home in about two minutes using Lucira's easy-to-use \"swab, stir and detect\" Check-It test kit.</p>\n<p><b><span>About Lucira Health</span></b></p>\n<p>Lucira is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits.
