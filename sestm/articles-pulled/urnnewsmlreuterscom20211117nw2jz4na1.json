From then until early 2012, their business consisted of two practices: IT Staffing and Business Intelligence Solution Design and Implementation. In early 2012, their first customer asked for help migrating their initial workloads to AWS. Based upon their track record of successfully completing sophisticated on-premise projects, multiple a2c customers came to depend on them to lead their charge into the Cloud. By year end, they completed a dozen migrations. In 2013, that number more than doubled. From migrations to data analytics and machine learning, they leverage their superpowers to unlock those of their clients, enabling them to optimize and ultimately monetize their data in the Cloud. Fast forward nine years and over 100 AWS projects later, a2c Consulting created a separate organization to focus on AWS Cloud professional services and A2C Cloud is born.\n</p><p></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20211117006223r1&amp;sid=ny6r2&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9jdHMuYnVzaW5lc3N3aXJlLmNvbS9jdC9DVD9pZD1id25ld3Mmc3R5PTIwMjExMTE3MDA2MjIzcjEmc2lkPW55NnIyJmRpc3Rybz1ueCZsYW5nPWVu&amp;key=605f35ead32fa388f2c65776ee8eb545ad1a0ecd3a0ec7d2c3ca8610ca8c60f411fe98d44dd2e8b3b4cb9de2ec5d1041d8f58b2e1bbf08848df220a02bdacf2d\"/></div></div><span class=\"bwct31415\"><p></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211117006223/en/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211117006223/en/</a></span></p><p>\nFor details on the partnership, visit <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.A2Ccloud.com&amp;esheet=52533231&amp;newsitemid=20211117006223&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.A2Ccloud.com&amp;index=5&amp;md5=59d7647a1ef85216676468d18f049985\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.A2Ccloud.com</a>.\n</p><p>\nA2C Cloud Sales &amp; Marketing Leader\n<br/>Vincent Augello\n<br/><a href=\"mailto:vincent@a2ccloud.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">vincent@a2ccloud.com</a><br/>908-329-7358\n</p></span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright Business Wire 2021</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-slugline\">Keywords: PA-A2C-CLOUD</p></div>"}
