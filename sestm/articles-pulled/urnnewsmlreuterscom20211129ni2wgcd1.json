The study evaluates the vocal behavior of a dolphin population isolated for more than three decades in a reservoir in Lake Balbina, in the municipality of Presidente Figueiredo (AM). A visual count of the number of these mammals in the reservoir is also being carried out to estimate the size of the isolated population.</p><p>The study will compare the animal vocalizations with those of porpoise populations outside Lake Balbina. The comparison will be used to verify whether isolation ? greater than the species' generational time ? affected the vocal structure of mammals. This data will show, along with the visual count, how these animals adapt to the reservoirs. This information is essential for the conservation of Amazon porpoises in the medium and long term.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>With the aid of hydrophones and recorders, the vocalizations of the dolphinsare recorded and then analyzed and compared with the sounds of other populations of the species outside Lake Balbina. The assessment includes behaviors associated with sounds, whose frequency varies according to the aggressive or sociable behavior of the animal. The red dolphin species produces about 14 types of vocal emissions, such as jaw snaps, echolocation clicks and even whistles.</p><p>The Amazon Aquatic Mammals project seeks to protect mammals and aquatic ecosystems through studies of ecology, natural history and animal behavior. The initiative also works to integrate with riverside communities and the sustainable use of natural resources.</p><p>Through the Petrobras Socioenvironmental Program, Petrobras invests in projects and actions to expand knowledge, conservation and recovery of biodiversity.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.</p></div>"}
