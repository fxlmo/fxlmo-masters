The bottom line also declined 50.5% from the year-ago quarter and 59.5% from the previous quarter.Net sales of $110.81 billion rose 15% year over year but declined 2% sequentially. Notably, the figure was within the management's guidance of $106-$112 billion.

International revenues (26% of sales) climbed 16% year over year to $29.1 billion. Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") revenues (15% of sales) rose 39% year over year to $16.1 billion.Year-over-year revenues growth was driven by a solid AWS momentum.Strong momentum across Prime members remained another positive. The company witnessed strong growth in its subscription services in the reported quarter. Sales from the services went up 24% from the prior-year quarter to $8.15 billion.Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers remained a major positive. In the reported quarter, sales generated by third-party seller services rose 19% on a year-over-year basis to $24.2 billion.Strengthening smart device offerings continued to benefit the company's third-quarter performance. Favorable foreign exchange rates drove top-line growth further.However, sluggish growth in the company's e-commerce sales affected its third-quarter results. Online store sales rose 3% from the prior-year quarter to $49.9 billion in the reported quarter.Uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic, foreign exchange fluctuations, changing customer preferences, labor shortages in the market and supply-chain disruptions remain overhangs for the company.Amazon expects to incur huge expenses in the fourth quarter, owing to supply-chain constraints, labor supply shortages, and rising freight and shipping costs.Nevertheless, the company's strong global presence, growing Prime momentum, robust data center network and an increasing number of AWS regions, improving Alexa skills, expanding smart devices portfolio, and growing efforts toward gaining strong traction among small and medium businesses are likely to drive its near-term financial performance.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Amazon.com, Inc.
