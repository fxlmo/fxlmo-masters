The CAP program intentionally delivers more opportunities, deeper capabilities and a streamlined procurement process in the shared commitment to support efficient and lasting growth within the consistently expanding public sector space.\n</p><p>\nIn collaboration with Strategic Communications (Women Owned Small Business &amp; 8(a) JV, and Minority Business Enterprise) and their Promark-led contract portfolio, the Contracts Alliance Program helps remove barriers in cloud-based opportunities within the public sector by providing Ingram Micro Cloud partners with access to a portfolio of federal, state, local and education contracts that are widely used to procure cloud services vital to public agency missions.\n</p><p>\n\u201cIngram Micro Cloud is proud to introduce the Contracts Alliance Program,\u201d says Jason Singer, Director of Public Sector Cloud at Ingram Micro Cloud. \u201cThis program is another affirmation of our commitment to partners as they strategically scale their businesses in the private and public sector markets.\u201d\n</p><p>\nPartners can accelerate opportunities in the public sector by combining CAP with AWS programs including Think Big for Small Business (TBSB). With TBSB, partners with less than 150 employees can further their AWS Partner Network tier progression and maximize earning opportunities while benefitting from CAP to minimize contract administration fees.\n</p><p>\n\u201cWe have witnessed a flood of cloud opportunities over the past 12 months from the public sector,\u201d said Blake Kelly, Cloud Sales Manager at Strategic Communications. \u201cCAP enables partners by providing access to opportunities in high demand and low competition through use of our set-aside contracts.\u201d\n</p><p>\nFind more information about Ingram Micro Cloud\u2019s AWS business <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnow.ingrammicrocloud.com%2Faws&amp;esheet=52544361&amp;newsitemid=20211207005023&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c30f300eb2a4ff760da3133878cf78df\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">here</a>.\n</p><p>\n<b>About Ingram Micro Cloud</b>\n</p><p>\nIngram Micro Cloud brings together innovators and problem solvers to help the world accomplish more.
