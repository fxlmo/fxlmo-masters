Natalie Powell reports.<br/>Short Link: <a href=\"https://refini.tv/3nz41gl\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://refini.tv/3nz41gl</a><br/><br/>Video Transcript:<br/><br/>E-commerce giant Amazon will continue to accept UK-issued visa credit cards on its British website. The company emailed customers on Monday with the update. Now back in November, the retail giant took the controversial step, saying it would ban the use of Visa credit cards because of high transaction fees. Since Brexit, the EU's enforced-cap on the fees charged by card issuers no longer applies in the UK. Amazon took the decision to ban UK-issued credit cards from Visa as of January 19, arguing the cost of accepting card payments continues to go up and that was 'an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best price for customers' Visa, at the time, responded saying it was disappointed that Amazon was threatening to restrict consumer choice. But according to Amazon, this latest U-turn comes as the company is working closely with Visa to reach an agreement.</span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
