(\"First Mining\" or the \"Company\") is pleased\nto provide an update on the ongoing technical work at its Springpole Gold\nProject (\"Springpole\" or the \"Project\") located in Ontario.\n\n     Since completing the Pre-Feasibility Study for Springpole (the\n\"Springpole PFS\") in January 2021, First Mining has been engaged in a\nnumber of significant technical programs to further optimize the\ndevelopment plan for Springpole and to further define the project scope for\nthe Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") process and into the Feasibility Study\n(\"FS\") process. These programs are ongoing and include Feasibility-level\nmetallurgical test work, reviewing opportunities to reduce the project's\ngreenhouse gas footprint (\"GHG\"), exploring renewable power generation\nopportunities, environmental data collection, and EA document preparation.\n\n     Metallurgical Program\n\n     The focus of the Feasibility-level metallurgical program is to confirm\nmetallurgical information and the process design of the Springpole PFS and\nexplore opportunities to enhance metal recoveries and reduce operating and\ncapital costs for Springpole by testing advanced flotation technologies,\nincluding the Woodgrove Direct Flotation Reactor. The metallurgical testing\nin 2021 took 2.4 tonnes of metallurgical samples collected from 10 drill\nholes to form three production composites that underwent advanced\nmetallurgical testing, as well as 10 variability composites. The initial\nresults support the test work and assumptions that were used in the\nSpringpole PFS and warrant a more detailed analysis of simplifying the\nflotation flow sheet, compared to the Springpole PFS.\n\n     Filtration test work is also underway to optimize the size of the\nfilter plant that feeds the dry-stack tailings facility. There is a\npotential opportunity to reduce the size of the filter plant which may\nrepresent a potential decrease to the initial process plant capital cost,\nwhen compared to the Springpole PFS. More detailed analysis will be\ncompleted during the FS.\n\n     First Mining will release results from the metallurgical program when\nit is completed, which is expected to be in Q2 2022.\n\n     Greenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") Footprint Reduction - Electric Assist Haul\nTrucks\n\n     Following the completion of the Springpole PFS, First Mining completed\nan analysis of potential GHG emissions from the Project and determined that\nopportunities exist to reduce GHG emissions by reducing diesel consumption\nassociated with the haul trucks with the addition of trolley assist in\nvarious areas of the mine. Given that the Project is scoped to be tied to\nthe power grid, First Mining commissioned AGP Consulting to study the\nimpact and benefit of a number of electric haul assist technologies. More\ndetailed analysis is warranted and will be carried out during the FS.\n\n     Renewable Power Generation Opportunities\n\n     First Mining commissioned SLR Consulting (\"SLR\") to complete an\ninitial scoping study of the opportunities to incorporate renewable power\ngeneration into the project development plan at Springpole. The Springpole\narea is endowed with potentially economic wind and solar resources, as well\nas a significant biomass opportunity which has been previously studied for\nthe region. The SLR study concluded that wind and solar were both viable\npotential supplemental power sources for the Project that warrant further\nstudy. In furtherance of this, First Mining has commenced site-specific,\ninvestment grade data collection for wind resources and will explore\nopportunities with the local communities to better understand avenues for\npartnership in a potential renewable power development.\n\n     Environmental Data Collection\n\n     The 2021 environmental field work activities involved a comprehensive\nprogram to supplement the baseline data that had been collected over\nseveral previous years. The studies covered a broad range of disciplines\nacross the biological, physical and human environments including air\nquality, noise, surface water, groundwater, geochemistry, aquatic biology,\nterrestrial vegetation and wildlife, archaeology, and cultural heritage.\nTwo air quality monitoring stations near the Project site have been\nestablished to gather continuous samples, and noise levels were measured at\ntwo monitoring locations under \"leaves-on\" and \"leaves-off\" conditions.\n\n     Surface water studies included monthly surface water quality sampling\nat 25 locations, flow measurements at six locations, and lake level\nmeasurements at eight locations. Hydrogeological testing was conducted to\nimprove the understanding of groundwater movement in the area and\ngroundwater quality samples were collected at 11 monitoring wells. The\ngeochemical characterization program included static and kinetic testing of\nmine rock and tailings as well as static testing of aggregate and\noverburden. An aerial survey was undertaken early in the year to study\nBoreal Caribou and other ungulates and furbearers.\n\n     Other key wildlife and habitat studies included bird and bat surveys\nas well as vegetation community and wetland mapping. Extensive aquatic\nstudies were undertaken including fish community and habitat assessments,\nfish tissue sampling, as well as plankton and benthic invertebrate studies.\nA Stage 2 Archaeological Assessment for the mine site area and cultural\nheritage information gathering and evaluation were also completed in 2021.\nThe information collected will inform the EA and First Mining will continue\nto collect data on the existing environment in 2022 to support future\npermitting.\n\n     Environmental Assessment Preparation\n\n     Following a successful environmental field season and the approval of\nthe Provincial EA Terms of Reference on November 8, 2021, Wood plc, on\nbehalf of First Mining, has undertaken technical modelling to inform the EA\ndocumentation covering key areas of the environment at Springpole,\nincluding geochemistry, groundwater quantity and quality, surface water\nquality, hydrology, air quality, noise and vibration, and terrestrial\ncomponents. The technical work is being documented and will be presented in\na draft EA that will be publicly disclosed and available for review when\ncompleted.\n\n     Key Catalysts for Springpole Project Development in 2022\n\n     First Mining is anticipating a number of important project\nadvancements in 2022, including:\n\n  * Commencement of Feasibility Study process\n  * Results of metallurgical studies expected in Q2 2022\n  * Final results of other process optimization trade-off studies to be\nincluded in the FS\n  * Completion and submission of the Draft Environmental Assessment\n\n     Senior Management Change\n\n     Ken Engquist, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, will be leaving\nhis role at First Mining, effective January 14, 2022, to pursue another\nopportunity in the mining industry.\n\n     Over the past year, under Ken's leadership, First Mining has built a\nstrong team of VP-level professionals that will ensure the continuity of\nFirst Mining's ongoing technical and environmental programs at its mineral\nprojects, including Steve Lines, VP, Environment and Community Relations,\nDavid Baldwin, VP, Project Development and James Maxwell, VP, Exploration.\nSteve, David and James are all part of First Mining's senior leadership\nteam and will ensure a seamless transition as First Mining continues to\nadvance its exploration and development objectives. First Mining has\ncommenced a search for a new Chief Operating Officer.\n\n     \"Ken has been an important member of the team since joining First\nMining in 2019 and we are thankful for his contributions. We wish him well\nin his future endeavours,\" stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. \"First\nMining has assembled a highly experienced team over the last couple of\nyears and we look forward to continued progress under the technical\nleadership of Steve, David and James as we advance Springpole and our other\nprojects.\"\n\n     Qualified Person\n\n     Hazel Mullin, P.Geo., Director, Data Management and Technical Services\nof First Mining, is a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National\nInstrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and she has\nreviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in\nthis news release.\n\n     About First Mining Gold Corp.\n\n     First Mining is a Canadian gold developer focused on the development\nand permitting of the Springpole Gold Project in northwestern Ontario.\nSpringpole is one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in Canada.
