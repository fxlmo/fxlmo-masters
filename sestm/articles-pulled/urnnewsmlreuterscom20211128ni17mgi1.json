Our tester also raved about the fries it produced, which it managed to cook perfectly even when the basket was loaded with three pounds worth of frozen taters. Other foods, including chicken, came out with crackling crusts that made our tester feel as though they'd been deep fried, even though they were cooked in thin air. The only downsides were the air fryer was a bit noisier than others we tested and it took up substantial counter space.</p><p>If you're looking for a smaller option\u2014not to worry, we've rounded up all the best deals from the chunky-but-great Philips XXL, to the slimmer profile Cuisinart AFR-25.\u00a0</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">The best air fryer Black Friday deals</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li><span>Black and Decker Crisp N' Bake Air Fryer Toaster Oven at Kohl's for $59.49 (Save $30.50)</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Cosori Air Fryer 5.8-Quart with Knob from Amazon for $75.98 (Save $14.01)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Dash Deluxe Electric Air Fryer from Amazon for $79.99 (Save $20)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Cosori Pro XL 5.8-Quart 11-in-1 Air Fryer from Kohl's for $81.59 with coupon code ENJOY15 (Save $68.40)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Cuisinart AFR-25\u00a0Compact Air Fryer Oven for $84.99 from Amazon with coupon (Save $14.96)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Ninja\u00a0AF150AMZ Air Fryer XL 5.5-Quart Capacity from Amazon for $99.95 (Save $50.04)</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Ninja Foodi 4-in-1 8-Quart 2-Basket Air Fryer with DualZone Technology from Walmart for $139 (Save $20.99)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Instant Omni Plus Air Fryer Toaster Oven from Amazon for $139.95 (Save $110.04)</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Philips Essential Air Fryer XL from Amazon for $149.95 (Save $50)\u00a0</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven, Air Fryer from Amazon for $154.99 with coupon\u00a0(Save $44.96)</span> \u00a0 <br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 Digital Air Fry Sheet Pan Oven at QVC for $169.98 (Save $39.02)</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Ninja Foodi 8-Quart 9-in-1 Deluxe XL Pressure Cooker and Air Fryer at QVC for $179.98\u00a0(Save $62)</span><br/> \u00a0</li><li><span>Philips Premium Air fryer XXL with Fat Removal Technology from Amazon for $199.95 (Save $150)\u00a0</span> </li> </ul><p><span><span>There's more where this deal came from.</span> Sign up for Reviewed's Perks and Rec newsletter and we'll keep 'em coming every Sunday through Friday.</span> </p><p><span>The product experts at <span>Reviewed</span> have all your shopping needs covered.
