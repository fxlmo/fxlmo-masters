What's more, transparency related to profit leakage associated with overbillings and deductions is limited. Up to 90% of deductions are out of vendors' lines of sight.</p>\n<p>DimeTyd's platform is a whole lifecycle, 100% automated, logic-based solution that offers vendors seamless recuperation of up to 93% of profit leakage based on Amazon accounting errors across several years of transactions. The platform identifies, tracks, and resolves costly e-commerce Vendor Central overbillings and deductions, including identifying errors in claims, duplicate billing, and more than 100 potential billing categories. DimeTyd's automated accounting platform analyzes up to five years' worth of accounting data and automatically reports the errors and recoups funds back to the vendor. </p>\n<p>\"The reality is that most vendors selling to Amazon do not have the in-house capacity or advanced technology necessary to accurately process the volumes of complex data produced within ongoing transactions. As a result, they are losing profits,\" continued Thambrahalli. \"Our platform is frictionless, automated, and eliminates human errors to provide profitability back to the vendor and correct issues going forward. It's a game changer for vendors.\" </p>\n<p>The DimeTyd platform enables: </p>\n<ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>Visibility into overbilling and deductions at scale </li><li>Automated know-how to identify and recoup funds rapidly </li><li>Precision alignment with Amazon's complex accounting system </li><li>Recuperation of lost profitability up to five years </li></ul><p>The DimeTyd platform requires no upfront cost and is available based on a percentage of recovered funds. </p>\n<p><b>About DimeTyd</b></p>\n<p>DimeTyd's platform is an advanced 100% automated, logic-based engine that offers vendors seamless recuperation of profit leakage based on Amazon accounting errors. The platform conducts an audit of lost revenues dating back up to five years and processes millions of data points to recoup funds to vendors seamlessly.
