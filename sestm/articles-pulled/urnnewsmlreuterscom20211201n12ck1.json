The collaboration will support the secure migration of clinical data using IMO's industry leading medical terminology, regulatory code mapping, and semantic normalization capabilities. IMO's technology allows AWS customers to migrate their health data to a cloud native environment quickly and seamlessly.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          This collaboration benefits healthcare and life sciences customers looking to move clinical data sets to AWS and those needing support to unlock the value of that data currently held within the proprietary schemas of electronic health records (EHRs) and other systems. The data being securely migrated includes clinical data for diagnosis, conditions, and treatments from surgeries, medications, labs, imaging, and radiology.\n        </p>\n                  <p>\n          Data quality is a critical component of managing population health and supporting artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. Moving to the cloud helps to maintain data retention compliance requirements which in turn helps to maximize an organization's operational and cost efficiencies.\n        </p>\n                  <h4>\n          Read the full press release <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201005239/en/Intelligent-Medical-Objects-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Collaborate-to-Enhance-Data-Led-Cloud-Migrations-in-Healthcare\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">here</a>.\n        </h4>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>Share on facebook</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>Share on twitter</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>Share on linkedin</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>Share on email</span>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h4>\n            Ideas are meant for sharing.\n          </h4>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h4>\n            Sign up today and have Ideas delivered straight to your inbox.\n          </h4>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"public_attachments\">\n                <p>\n                  <strong>Attachments</strong>\n                </p>\n                <ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n                  <li>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.imohealth.com/ideas/article/imo-amazon-web-services-collaborate-on-data-led-cloud-migrations/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Original document</a>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"public_disclaimer\">\n                <p>\n                  <strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <strong>Intelligent Medical Objects Inc.</strong> published this content on <strong>01 December 2021</strong> and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.
