(0845 EST/1345 GMT)</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=.IXIC\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\".IXIC\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">.IXIC</a> was recently sailing along. Into its 15,982.357 November 8 close, the tech-laden index posted a run of 11-straight up-days, including eight-straight record finishes. Those were its longest such streaks since 11 and 10-day runs in December 2019.</p><p>With its recent rally to an intraday high of 16,053.386, the Composite nearly tagged a monthly log-scale channel resistance parallel, which in November resides around 16,300. This hurdle is based off of a support line drawn from the 2009 low:</p><p><br/></p><p><div class=\"tr-resource-ref\" id=\"ca36165d-03ae-4009-b914-1dc719624084\"><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/egpbkajrnvq/IXIC11122021.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5nZngudGhvbXNvbnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2dmeC9idXp6L2VncGJrYWpybnZxL0lYSUMxMTEyMjAyMS5wbmc=&amp;storyId=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20211112:nL1N2S319H:3&amp;key=4199fce7eb9314c6835f74f526df6ab76021b763350f1c11abf37904a1b2b20f20fc17053116e41c01365e41bad315936b034a34b3ca0d7ebd70881c75662b10\"/></div></div></div></p><p><br/></p><p>The IXIC then fell back more than 3% in just three trading days. Of note, upon nearly tagging this line in March and again in September, the Composite promptly suffered declines of nearly 13% and 8%, so it appears to be a formidable barrier.</p><p>Meanwhile, monthly momentum is lagging. Although the RSI is rising from its September, it remains shy of its August high, despite the Nasdaq's fresh records.</p><p>Just looking back to late 2018, a number of severe Nasdaq sell offs were preceded by multi-month momentum divergence.</p><p>Therefore, traders may be on guard for an RSI down-tick as it could solidify the divergence. In the event, the Composite may find itself tossed about in rougher seas. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2S20VT\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2S20VT\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>  </p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p>     </p><p>FOR FRIDAY'S LIVE MARKETS' POSTS PRIOR TO 0845 EST/1345 GMT - CLICK HERE: <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL8N2S34RO\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL8N2S34RO\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Terence Gabriel is a Reuters market analyst.
