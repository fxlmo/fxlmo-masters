Sarawak Energy provides electricity to over three million people and serves a customer base of over 700,000 companies in the domestic, commercial, industrial and export space.</p><p>Digitalization of key business systems contributes to this goal by enabling the company to drive excellence in its operations, advance its sustainable growth agenda and deliver value to all its stakeholders and customers.</p><p>As part of this process, Sarawak Energy has begun a journey to transition its existing SAP S/4HANA to AWS. A consolidation between the larger and more critical SAP ERP Central Component 6.0 system with the existing S\\4HANA will start next year.</p><p>The move will provide Sarawak Energy a more secure, stable, flexible, and cost-effective environment for its SAP assets. Following a thorough search and evaluation of various value-added service providers, the company is made the decision to partner with Lemongrass to migrate and manage its core system.</p><p>\u201cSarawak Energy aspires to become a sustainable digital utility by 2025, as part of our Sarawak Energy Excellence 2022 roadmap. We continue to learn and adopt new technologies to maintain our relevance and grow value, leveraging digital technologies to stay competitive in this age of rapid change.
