A score of five indicates that a company is a dominant player in this space, while companies that score less than three are vulnerable to being left behind. These can be read fairly straightforwardly.The other datapoints in the table are more nuanced, showcasing recent cybersecurity investment across a range of areas over the past year. These metrics give an indication of whether cybersecurity is at the top of executives' minds now, but high numbers in these fields are just as likely to represent desperate attempts to catch-up as they are genuine strength in cybersecurity.For example, a high number of mentions of cybersecurity in quarterly company filings could indicate either the company is reaping the rewards of previous investments, or it needs to invest more to catch up with the rest of the industry. Similarly, a high number of deals could indicate that a company is dominating the market, or that it is using mergers and acquisitions to fill in gaps in its offering.This article is based on GlobalData research figures as of 13 January 2022.
