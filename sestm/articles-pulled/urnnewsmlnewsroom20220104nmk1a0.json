We will work together to help ensure the prosperity of our economy,\"</span> adds <span>Benoit Lacoste Bienvenue</span> , Regional Managing Partner, KPMG Canada, Quebec Region.</p>\n<p>More than half of companies surveyed say they do not have a sustainable development objective or policy in place. However, 68 percent of respondents, as consumers, say they are influenced by environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) in their consumption choices. In addition, 67 percent of respondents say ESG factors are an important consideration in their choice of employers.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"The awareness of entrepreneurs to ESG criteria, revealed by KPMG's Focus Qu\u00e9bec 2025 survey, offers many opportunities for <span>Quebec</span> companies to grow and develop their workforce. It is important to build on our strengths in research and innovation, as well as to encourage our entrepreneurs to collaborate and exchange, to help us stand out in national and international markets,\"</span> says <span>Pierre Fitzgibbon</span> , Minister of Economy and Innovation and Minister Responsible for Regional Economic Development.</p>\n<p>Nearly half of respondents say they must rethink their distribution network due to changes in consumer behaviour. Seventy-three percent of respondents, who are themselves consumers, say they now prefer to buy online and want fast, free delivery.</p>\n<p>To ensure organizations are able to meet the needs of their customers, solutions include positioning distribution centres closer to consumers, identifying the best-selling and most delivered products, or keeping a larger inventory of a limited number of best-selling products. Distribution network optimization can lead to a 5 to 10 percent reduction in operational costs.</p>\n<p>In-depth analyses of the survey results by region will continue throughout 2022 and will be announced to entrepreneurs across the province. A series of events will be organized in collaboration with companies established in the region, educational institutions and other business partners to promote the sharing of best practices. These events will be held in <span>Sherbrooke</span> , <span>Quebec City</span> , <span>Drummondville</span> , <span>Montreal</span> , as well as in the regions of Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"</span> Solutions are emerging and allow us to transition from awareness to action. These major challenges provide important elements of differentiation that companies must take advantage of. As a growth accelerator, we want to contribute to the emergence of these new leaders, <span>\"</span> adds <span>Pierre Marcouiller</span> , president of NEXCAP.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Survey Highlights</span>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>More than half of companies that responded to the survey said they do not have a sustainability goal or policy.</li>\n<li>68 percent of respondents say they are influenced as consumers by environmental, social and governance factors (ESG).</li>\n<li>The ESG factors that influence most respondents include supporting the local economy and local jobs and choosing recyclable and/or compostable materials.</li>\n<li>72 percent of respondents consider an organization to be an employer of choice when it takes a stand on a social issue that is consistent with their values.</li>\n<li>76 percent of respondents said sustainability is an important factor in the development of new products.</li>\n<li>Nearly half of respondents said they need to review their distribution network to reduce total supply chain costs (an important benefit for 72 percent of respondents) and meet changing consumer needs.</li>\n<li>73 percent of respondents said they buy online as soon as possible and want fast and free delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>About the Focus Quebec 2025 study</span>\n</p>\n<p>Of the 767 survey respondents, 64 percent hold an executive position and 200 hold a president position.
