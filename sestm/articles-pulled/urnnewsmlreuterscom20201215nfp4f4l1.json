The premium was marketed at 40%\u201345% above the reference price set in an accompanying delta placement.</p>\n              <p>The deal was multiple times covered on pre-sounding in advance of launch.</p>\n              <p>A credit assumption of 225bp was based on outstanding paper, with borrow available at 50bp.</p>\n              <p>Books were covered within 45 minutes of launching after the close on Monday. After 7pm, investors were guided that orders not at 100% of issue price and 45% premium risked missing out, with pricing in the delta expected to come at \u20ac4.30 and books closing at 7:30pm.</p>\n              <p>A banker involved said that the impetus for a post-close launch was that the time of year meant lower trading volumes, which could have translated into a lower reference share price. \u201cWe thought we could get better control on stock slippage through a post-market close placement,\u201d he said.</p>\n              <p>Pricing came at par with a 45% premium over the \u20ac4.30 reference price representing a conversion price of \u20ac6.235. The delta placing comprised 12.1m shares totalling \u20ac52m, having launched with expectations of no more than \u20ac75m. The discount was 4.2% to the \u20ac4.489 close, with shares down 16% year-to-date.</p>\n              <p>On pricing, implied vol was 35% and the bond floor was 91.7%. Shares briefly traded above the conversion price in 2019.</p>\n              <p>The banker said that the decision was taken to favour the premium over the yield, especially as Pirelli has two large shareholders in China National Chemical Corporation and Camfin, owned by Pirelli chief executive Marco Tronchetti Provera, that are sensitive to dilution.</p>\n              <p>A book of around 100 lines was dominated by outright orders, including all of the top five orders.</p>\n              <p>The banker said that despite the deal coming late in the year there was feedback that some accounts would have preferred a larger deal. He said that the pipeline for January is already building.</p>\n              <p>Proceeds for Pirelli will be used to refinance debt and for general corporate purposes.</p>\n              <p>The bonds were trading around 101% on Tuesday morning.</p>\n              <p>Pirelli\u2019s fundraising will take European equity-linked issuance for 2020 to approximately US$34.87bn. That is not quite the mammoth US$36.3bn recorded when equity-linked returned in 2009 after the financial crisis, but is the best annual tally for the region in the product since then.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Credit Suisse</span> and <span>Goldman Sachs</span> were global coordinators, and bookrunners with <span>Banca IMI</span>, <span>BNP Paribas</span>, <span>CICC</span>, <span>Mizuho International</span> and <span>UniCredit</span>.</p>\n              <p>\n                <strong>Scandinavian Biogas Fuels</strong> has completed its SKr520.2m (US$62.1m) Premier Growth Market Stockholm IPO with a multiple times covered book from investors attracted by the company's green credentials.</p>\n              <p>It will become the first listed company to receive a dark green rating from second opinion provider Cicero Shades of Green when it begins trading on Wednesday.</p>\n              <p>IPO pricing was fixed at launch at SKr37.50 per share, with the company issuing 9.33m new shares and 4.53m shares sold by Ahlstrom Capital, Apriori and family-owned company John Nurminen. Separately, management acquired 324,919 shares from shareholder AC Cleantech Growth Fund.</p>\n              <p>A book of fewer than 100 lines was multiple times covered with strong demand from domestic money and pan-Nordic accounts, as well as good support from the UK and Germany, and ESG and energy specialists.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>ABG Sundal Collier</span> was bookrunner.</p>\n              <p>Primary proceeds of SKr350m will fund expansion of the company\u2019s production capacity, primarily within liquid biogas, through investments in new plants and to part-refinance the November acquisition of Ekdalens Biotransporter, which transports organic materials to biogas facilities in southern Sweden.

The shares started the year at 52.3p, dropped to a low close of 30.4p earlier this month and finished on Monday at 35.5p. The shares closed up more than 12.6% on Tuesday at 40p.</p>\n              <p>The company\u2019s Turkish business accounted for approximately 68% of its sales in the 10 months to October 31 but DP said London will remain its principal market. Nine new stores were opened in Turkey during 2020, with leases signed for another 16 stores that are due to open in December or early 2021. Sales in the 10 months ended October 31 were up nearly 12% over 2019, driven by online orders accelerating during the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic.</p>\n              <p>Morgan Stanley was global coordinator, and\u00a0bookrunner\u00a0with\u00a0Citigroup\u00a0on the 2017 IPO.</p>\n              <p>Online clothing and\u00a0homeware\u00a0company\u00a0<strong>N\u00a0Brown</strong>\u00a0secured solid if not overwhelming support from shareholders for its \u00a3100m open offer that was fully guaranteed by members of the Alliance family, the company\u2019s main shareholders.</p>\n              <p>Shareholders, excluding the Alliances, bought 34% of the open offer shares. Adding David Alliance, who was chairman of the company for 44 years until 2012, and his son Joshua who together owned 44.8% of the company prior to the offering makes for effective take-up of 78.8% from the offer of 174.7m shares at 57p each.</p>\n              <p>There was oversubscription of 7.7m shares in addition to that from the Alliances, so both were scaled back with 1.3m shares going to independent shareholders and 35.1m to the Alliances.
