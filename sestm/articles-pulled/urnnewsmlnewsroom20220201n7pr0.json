Together\nwith u-blox's existing zero touch provisioning service, it provides            \nout-of-the-box on-boarding to IoT cloud platforms with total control of the    \ndevice certificate lifecycle.                                                  \n                                                                               \nCertificate lifecycle control targets IoT devices that integrate with leading  \nIoT cloud platforms including the AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub, and DPS         \nservices. While these take charge of device management and data aggregation,   \nthe u-blox service provides an effortless, secure, and cost-effective way to   \nmanage the X.509 certificates required for device authentication.              \n                                                                               \nX.509 certificates have become a cornerstone of IoT security. Secure           \nprovisioning requires extensive experience, complex software development, and  \nrobust production line tools and processes.                                    \n                                                                               \nCertificate management efforts grow exponentially with increasing fleet size.  \nWhile in the past issued certificates remained valid throughout a device's     \nlifecycle, increases in infrastructure complexity and risks have forced        \nregulatory authorities to demand more frequent - yearly or monthly - renewals. \nFailure to meet renewal deadlines can expose devices to cyberthreats, disrupt  \nservice availability, and undermine business.                                  \n                                                                               \nIoT certificate manager simplifies scaling...                                  \n                                                                               \nu-blox new IoT certificate manager eliminates the task of manually managing    \ncredential renewal on thousands of devices. Designed and optimized for IoT     \nscenarios, it eliminates the errors that can occur during manual operation on  \nlarge IoT deployments, freeing resources for other activities. Delivery via the\nintuitive Thingstream IoT service delivery platform with its simple and        \nflexible price plans lets users engage more efficiently and reduce time to     \nmarket.                                                                        \n                                                                               \n... and futureproofs protection                                                \n                                                                               \nThe IoT certificate manager futureproofs protection by increasing security     \nlevels over the entire device lifetime.
