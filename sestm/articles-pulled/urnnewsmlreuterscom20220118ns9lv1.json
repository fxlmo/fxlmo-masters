Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, a real-time cloud computing platform, brings AWS compute and storage services to the edge of Verizon\u2019s wireless network. The combination minimizes the latency and network hops required to connect from an application hosted on the platform to the end user\u2019s device. Launched in <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=03opJ5fEO5Jtj1lx_U73hccXOyjOS4IBw_Jv6QO-nZ9L3_M2F-OHLaMHpah9-Gyz2KKZU8J8qaTR1evgpoHOOy69YXv2Ekrz1dD3R3ebPkA-MC_Fx9_6nqtGnllWvfiT\"><u>August 2020</u></a>, the companies currently offer mobile edge computing via AWS Wavelength Zones in 17 locations in the U.S. Using 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength allows developers and businesses to build and deploy a variety of applications such as machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and video and game streaming. \u00a0</p><p><strong>Using Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength for drone and energy management applications</strong></p><p>Fermata Energy, a Verizon Ventures company, and Easy Aerial are among the innovators who participated in the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=STcVAVqZCkK3ZI4TGQXu0X8tGzOHvq6-OFBUdc0RlDlJ83iBLklV7Gycov3hE9dSWbjHk74SAsFXAcvqqb-NXg6yJws9cLfmvbwHx2FqlXWfBuDnWfl3rqDyZmNjn2Dm1eSdOymGgR6bHUqsFXx90Fb5MT3VtDUXz4U5dFZgMS8=\"><u>5G Studio</u></a>, a collaboration between Verizon and Newlab, to develop transformative technology solutions leveraging Verizon\u2019s 5G Ultra Wideband network technology and Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength at Newlab.\u00a0</p><p>Easy Aerial is a leading provider of American-made, military-grade, autonomous drone-in-a-box-based monitoring and inspection solutions for commercial, government, and military applications. With the low end-to-end latency enabled by Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, Easy Aerial was able to collect and transfer live drone video for near real-time object detection and telemetry data for rapid processing and analysis. 5G and mobile edge computing also allowed expensive compute to be removed from the drone, reportedly saving about 10% in drone costs and increasing flight time by approximately 40%.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeing able to utilize the high bandwidth for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength provides is a game changer,\u201d said Ivan Stamatovski, CTO of Easy Aerial. \u201cIt shifts the paradigm on what is possible to achieve with airborne sensors by processing data at the edge of the network in near real-time.\u201d</p><p>Fermata Energy\u2019s Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology turns electric vehicles (EVs) into mini power plants by discharging energy services from EVs\u2019 batteries to the home, building, or energy grid. Using a bidirectional charger connected both to an EV and a building\u2019s energy load, Fermata Energy\u2019s cloud-based software, running on Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength, reacted to changes in the grid and, as a result, load-balance data in near real-time with very low latency, according to Fermata Energy. This allows Fermata Energy to dispatch an EV as a valuable energy resource providing near real-time response to the state of the grid.\u00a0</p><p>Watch the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LmO0eBKOCzLKkqiBPmQ-aSM5556myM2gT0MGdxdckeeGlqK5CdNc7P-_oZpbySPQ_guCj7EGbXfSuhDPz8oXNTUmlZwIRdNG85V0hky4mA0=\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Fermata video</a>\u00a0for more.</p><p><strong>Teaming with SaaS providers to make it a breeze for developers</strong></p><p>Verizon and AWS are also working with software as a service (SaaS) providers Couchbase and Confluent to make it easier for developers who use their platforms to create applications running on Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength. Using infrastructure templates, Verizon and AWS seamlessly extended the capabilities of these providers to the edge to automate the complexity of edge networking, core compute, and the software itself.\u00a0</p><p>Couchbase empowers developers to build, deploy and run their most mission-critical applications by providing a high-performance, flexible and scalable modern database that runs across the data center and any cloud.
