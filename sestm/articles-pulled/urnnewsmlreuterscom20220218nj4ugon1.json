The union said it was the first time rates had risen for owner drivers and contract couriers in 15 years.</p><p>\"They have put in place a model that deliberately classifies workers as independent contractors so they can try to place them outside the system of protections,\" Kaine said.</p><p>\"Amazon can now be held to account.\"</p><p>Amazon was not involved in the proceedings, which did not make any findings about their current practices.</p><p>Amazon launched Flex in Australia in 2020 and promoted the parcel delivery service as a way for people to make extra money.</p><p>It has about 2000 contractors signed up to the service, who all use their own cars and cover their overheads, like petrol. Many say it is impossible to make a living wage.</p><p>One Amazon driver, who asked not to be named, said drivers are currently paid in a lump sum for blocks of work and have to send a request for any overtime.</p><p>On Facebook, drivers share screenshots of blocks on offer.
