Our strategy sets specific goals and commitments, and for each of these, we have identified exactly how we will achieve them and the milestones along the way. Our Board and Executive Committee have been integral to developing this strategy which is fully aligned with the Company's corporate strategy and plans. \u00a0We have engaged with our stakeholders throughout the development of the strategy and undertook a detailed stakeholder consultation ahead of this launch. </span></p>\n<p class=\"ba\"><span class=\"av\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"ba\"><span class=\"av\">Our strategy is delivered through four sustainability pillars: 'Our business' which reflects our operations and the expansion of our network, 'Our people' which sets commitments around employee engagement, development, diversity and inclusion, 'Our community' which details our dedication to improving access to education, and 'Our environment' which is focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We have identified six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to which we believe our work will make a genuine and tangible contribution- they are SDG 4: Quality education, SDG 5: Gender equality, SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, SDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced inequalities, and SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ba\"><span class=\"av\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bb\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span class=\"av\">Segun Ogunsanya, CEO, Airtel Africa</span></span><span class=\"am\">, said: \"Today is a significant milestone in Airtel Africa's journey.
