The dispute started after Amazon sought to block the Reliance deal by getting a freeze order from a Singapore arbitration court, citing alleged violation of contractual agreements. The merged entity will pose formidable competition to the U.S. company\u2019s dominance in India.<br/><br/>The development comes against the backdrop of Future Retail seeking to vacate the emergency arbitrator's stay on sale of retail assets.<br/>   - By Ujjwal Narayan; Ujjwal.Narayan@newsrise.org; 01166767700<br/>- Edited by Gourab Das<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
