Pricing at the top of the revised offering range would see Rivian raise US$10bn and value the company at close to US$70bn on a fully diluted basis.\u00a0</p>\n              <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of who\u2019s going to be in the deal but how high a price they are prepared to pay,\u201d one buysider said.</p>\n              <p>Amazon, T.
