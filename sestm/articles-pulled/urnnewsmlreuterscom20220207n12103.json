This according to Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>According to Calvasina, at a little more than 50%, Tech has the highest percentage of companies with their stock prices up 1% or more immediately following their earnings among all of the GICS sectors.</p><p>On 2022 EPS growth forecasts, in percentage terms, she says that expectations have improved for energy, materials, healthcare, and tech. Meanwhile, they've weakened for consumer discretionary, communication services, financials and utilities. She adds that Growth and Value along with Secular, Cyclical and Defensives are well represented among both the leaders and laggards on this metric, \"lending support to the idea that the positioning trades feel a little messy from an earnings perspective at the moment.\"</p><p>That said, Calvasina also notes that the rate of upward EPS estimate revisions has been slightly stronger in Value than Growth, and weaker in Defensives than Cyclicals.</p><p>\"At the sector level, we prefer to look at the rate of upward revisions for both EPS and sales. And that vantage point once again reminds us that the story is a bit more complicated with Financials, REITs, and Energy (and to a lesser degree Tech and Health Care) outranking the other major sectors.\"</p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>STRONG CPI DATA COULD BOOST FED HIKE EXPECTATIONS, HURT BONDS (1100 EST/1600 GMT)</p><p>U.S. inflation data on Thursday may be key to whether the bond rout that has sent benchmark Treasury yields to two-year highs is likely to continue, with investors likely to price for more aggressive rate hikes if the number comes in stronger than expected, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Thursday is expected to show that prices rose 0.5% in January, and are up 7.3% on the year, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters.<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=EM\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"EM\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">EM</a> </p><p>However, \"an upside surprise next Thursday would mean further talk of the Fed raising rates 50bp in March. At a minimum, calls for the Fed to hike at every meeting this year will look much less off-base,\" Morgan Stanley analysts including Matthew Hornbach said in a report.</p><p>The Federal Reserve said last month that it is likely to hike interest rates in March as it tackles persistent inflation, though fed funds futures traders are pricing in only a 37% chance of a 50 basis point increase that month. Five increases of 25 basis points are priced in by December. <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=FEDWATCH\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"FEDWATCH\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FEDWATCH</a>  <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2U51RB\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2U51RB\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>\u201cAn upside surprise on January US CPI next week followed by further strength in nonfarm payrolls and even more inflation in February could get expectations of a 50bp hike in March to solidify. That outcome would certainly jolt expectations for Fed policy this year - and investors aren't adequately protected against that, given current market prices, we think,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts added.</p><p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=US10YT=RR\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"US10YT=RR\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">US10YT=RR</a> jumped to two-year highs on Monday, after data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy created far more jobs than expected in January, despite the disruption to consumer-facing businesses from a surge in COVID-19 cases.
