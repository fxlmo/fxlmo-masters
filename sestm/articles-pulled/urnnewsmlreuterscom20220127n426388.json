Yet it's becoming one of the better kinds of problem to have. Technology investors are worried the pandemic brought forward years of future revenue, especially for cloud-based companies, and that growth will now slow. The $2.6 trillion Apple instead may be poised for a rebound as it satiates pent-up demand for iPhones. </p><p>It's early, but 2022 has been a rough year for tech investors. Apple\u2019s stock is down about 10%. Peers Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>, Microsoft <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MSFT.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MSFT.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MSFT.O</a> and Facebook owner Meta Platforms <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=FB.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"FB.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FB.O</a> have done worse. And Apple has performed far better than highly valued upstarts, such as e-commerce outfit Shopify <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=SHOP.TO\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"SHOP.TO\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">SHOP.TO</a>, which has lost a third of its market capitalization in less than a month.</p><p>Apple shares trade at 27 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, using Refinitiv data. That\u2019s higher <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2T13UF\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2T13UF\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> than its recent average, but still lower than its giant tech peers. And it is far lower than multiples attached to fast-growing stocks: Shopify still trades at over 100 times estimated earnings. So there\u2019s less froth to be flattened at Apple.</p><p>Furthermore, while most internet-based tech firms have seen rapid top-line expansion during the pandemic, it has been more of a mixed bag for Apple. Sure, if people spend more time on phones in lockdown, that is good for the company\u2019s services business, which accounted for 22% of its total revenue of $83 billion in the quarter to September. But iPhone sales brought in over twice as much revenue that quarter. The company estimates silicon shortages and manufacturing disruptions reduced revenue by $6 billion in the period.</p><p>As the pandemic recedes, tech firms that have capitalized on virtual living should indeed see growth rates slow. In contrast, time will iron out Apple\u2019s supply-chain difficulties, as chip production expands and factory employees get back to work. </p><p>Cook will have new numbers for the last calendar quarter of 2021 to talk about on Thursday after market\u2019s close. Perhaps impatient customers might switch to a different phone, but Apple\u2019s users tend to be hard to dislodge. Apple had a 15% share of the global smartphone market last quarter according to researcher IDC, up from 12.5% five years ago. Besides, other handset makers have chip troubles too. The missing iPhone sales are probably just delayed.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_cyran\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@rob_cyran</a> on Twitter</p><p><br/></p><p>CONTEXT NEWS </p><p>-  Apple is set to report earnings for its second fiscal quarter to December on Jan. 27 after U.S. markets close.</p><p>- On Oct. 28, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a call with investors that supply constraints reduced revenue by about $6 billion in the quarter ending Sept. 25.
