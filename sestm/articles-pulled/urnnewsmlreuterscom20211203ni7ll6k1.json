Notably, the lesser the energy consumption, the lower will be the cost. Arm processors, widely used in smartphones and tablets, are commonly known for their low energy consumption. Consequently, the utilization of the processors makes cloud systems more efficient.Therefore, the Arm-based Graviton processors, which do not require an x86 instruction set that is expensive for the scale-out workloads, make AWS a more viable option in lowering costs.AWS offers a wide range of cost-effective and power-efficient compute instances. Apart from Graviton3-powered Amazon EC2 C7g instances, AWS's Graviton2 instance portfolio offers 12 different instances such as accelerated computing instances, storage optimized, compute optimized and memory optimized.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Efforts by Microsoft, Alphabet &amp; Oracle</p><p>Oracle recently introduced its first Arm compute instances called OCI Ampere A1, which leveled up its game with Amazon. Notably, OCI Ampere A1 costs one cent per core hour.Oracle, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), intends to accelerate app development and improvise application performance on its cloud infrastructure on the back of OCI Ampere A1.You can see<span><a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stocks/buy-list/?ADID=zp_1link_invideas&amp;ICID=zpi_1link_invideas\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</a> </span>Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google are yet to incorporate Arm-based chips in their cloud platforms.Reportedly, Microsoft has forayed into designing in-house Arm-based chips for Azure servers and Surface PCs. The Zacks Rank #3 company intends to produce a processor for use in its data centers by leveraging Arm designs.Alphabet's Google has hired Intel engineering veteran Uri Frank in an effort to design server chips. This is in sync with the Zacks Rank #1 company's increasing investment in customizing its chips in order to reduce energy use and increase performance across its cloud business.</p><p><span>Zacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"</span></p><p>From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.
