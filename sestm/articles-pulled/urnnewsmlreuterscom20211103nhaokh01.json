Xeon? Scalable processors. Amazon EC2 C6i instances are powered by 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and deliver up to 15% better price performance compared to C5 instances for a wide variety of workloads. In August, AWS announced its new EC2 M6i instances, which are also powered by the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors.</p><p>Where EC2 M6i instances are built for general-purpose computing, EC2 C6i instances are designed for compute-intensive workloads including high performance computing (HPC).</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>New EC2 C6i instances harness the increased core count, higher performance and built-in acceleration features included in the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors. EC2 C6i instances are built on the AWS Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor. EC2 C6i instances are available in nine sizes with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 96 and 128 virtual central processing units (vCPUs), the latter of which is meant to meet customer demands for increased scalability. The new instance size (c6i.32xlarge) features 128 vCPUs and 256 GiB of memory, 33% more than the largest C5 instance.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.</p></div>"}
