This includes the solution proposed in the term sheet between Samara Capital, and FRL, which contemplated an infusion of Rs 7,000 crore in FRL. The letter has also been sent to top executives at Union Bank of India, Bank of India, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank and Indian Bank.</p><p>\u0093We write further to our earlier letters, including letters dated December 2, 2020, April 23, 2021, and December 15, 2021 addressed to the independent directors of FRL,\u0094 stated Amazon's letter to the FRL independent directors, dated January 19, 2022, which Business Standard has seen. \u0093We reiterate our willingness and ability to assist FRL in addressing any financial concerns of FRL, within the framework of the agreements, including the solution proposed in the term sheet between Samara Capital, and FRL, which contemplated an infusion of Rs 7000,00,00,000 (Indian Rupees Seven Thousand Crores) in FRL.\u0094</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>According to sources, as early as June 2020, Amazon-backed private equity firm Samara Capital had signed a non-binding term sheet with Future Retail (FRL) that entailed a Rs 7,000-crore investment. This was two months prior to Kishore Biyani-led retailer Future Group announcing its Rs 24,713 crore ($3.4 billion) merger deal with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) at the end of August 2020.</p><p>\u0093Without prejudice to the above, Amazon reiterates that FRL is bound by valid and subsisting injunctions issued by the Arbitral Tribunal, and enforced by Indian Courts. Amongst others, FRL is prohibited from \u0093directly or indirectly taking any steps to transfer/dispose/alienate/encumber FRL\u0092s Retail Assets\u0094 without Amazon\u0092s consent,\u0094 statrd Amazon\u0092s letter.</p><p>Amazon has said in the letter that it has also become aware, from certain media sources, that FRL is proposing to sell its small-format stores, comprising the \u0093Easyday\" and \u0093Heritage Fresh\" brands.</p><p>\u0093Please note that any sale of small-format stores without obtaining the consent of Amazon would be in violation of the injunctions which continue to operate and are binding on FRL and directors of FRL, including the independent directors of FRL,\u0094 stated the letter.</p><p>Amazon said it has consistently emphasised its willingness to assist FRL before the Arbitral Tribunal and Indian Courts. Amazon, through its counsel, reiterated its commitment to finding solutions for FRL before the Supreme Court, as recently as January 11, 2021.</p><p>It has hereby nominated Abhijeet Muzumdar (Head of Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund and Corporate Development at Amazon) to lead any and all such engagements with interested stakeholders and decision-makers in FRL, including independent directors of FRL, to find a commercial solution for FRL.</p><p>\u0093We are more than willing to explore effective solutions to assist FRL,\u0094 stated the letter.</p><p>A query to Future Group and Amazon remained unanswered till the time of publishing.</p><p>This issue goes back to August 2019, when Amazon acquired a 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons, the promoter entity of FRL (Future Retail), for around Rs 1,500 crore. One year later, in August 2020, Future Group struck a $3.4-billion asset-sale deal with Reliance Industries (RIL).</p><p>In October 2020, Amazon had sent a legal notice to Future for striking a deal with RIL. It alleged that Future\u0092s $3.4-billion asset sale deal with RIL breached an agreement with Amazon. It cited its non-compete agreement with the Kishore Biyani-led chain. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules. The same month, October 2020, Amazon got a favourable ruling for its plea in SIAC against the deal.</p><p>In November 2020, Future moved the Delhi High Court (HC) against Amazon, alleging interference by the US firm in the deal with RIL. Since then, Amazon has been fighting a legal battle with FRL to stop Future\u0092s $3.4-billion deal with RIL.</p><p>Last year in December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended Amazon\u0092s 2019 deal worth Rs 1,500 crore with FRL citing the company\u0092s alleged deliberate design to suppress information about the scope and purpose of the deal. The anti-trust regulator had imposed a penalty of Rs 200 crore on Amazon to be paid within 60 days of receipt of the order.</p><p>This month, Amazon filed a legal challenge at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against CCI\u0092s suspension of Amazon\u0092s 2019 deal with FRL. Parallelly, Amazon\u0092s Indian unit also approached the Supreme Court against a halt on an arbitration case against FRL\u0092s asset sale to Reliance Industries (RIL).</p><p>Later this month, NCLAT agreed to hear Amazon\u0092s plea challenging CCI\u0092s suspension of approval to the 2019 transaction with Future Group on February 2. The appellate tribunal had directed CCI and Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) to file their reply in 10 days and Amazon to file a rejoinder.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
