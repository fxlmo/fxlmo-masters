This growing demand has increased companies\u2019 engagement with service providers that work with AWS.\n</p><p>\n\u201cInnovative service providers are responding to Australia\u2019s enterprise public cloud trend by extending and promoting their services and capabilities, even as they adapt their own businesses to new requirements such as remote work,\u201d said Scott Bertsch, partner and regional leader, ISG Asia Pacific. \u201cAWS is playing its part by investing in new tools and services and spending heavily on partnerships with providers.\u201d\n</p><p>\nManaged service providers (MSPs) have taken on more of what were traditionally considered system integrator roles as more companies move to the cloud and adjust to pandemic-related disruptions, the report says. Many MSPs are investing in additional skills, acquiring other providers and expanding their roles with AWS.\n</p><p>\nDigital transformation has made Australian enterprises more aware of how much business data they can gather and use, and the recent disruptions have made the need for data even more urgent, ISG says. More companies are now seeking advanced data analytics capabilities, including the use of machine learning, and many have adopted AWS as the platform of choice for these functions. Amid the shortage of skilled personnel in this field, enterprises are turning to service providers for analytics capabilities.\n</p><p>\nThe sharp expansion of remote work during the pandemic, as well as industrial disruptions such as supply chain issues and plant shutdowns and reconfigurations, have increased Australian investments in IoT, according to ISG. In response, service providers have quickly aligned their portfolios with the changing market, adding complementary services such as IoT analytics.\n</p><p>\nMany Australian companies pursuing digital transformation are migrating their SAP instances to AWS or implementing entirely new instances on the platform, the report says. The pandemic has only increased the pressure to move workloads to the cloud, and many enterprises are engaging with providers of SAP migration and management services.\n</p><p>\nThe ongoing business disruptions and transformations in Australia have also increased demand for enterprise IT consulting services covering workload migration, application modernization, workplace transformation, security, governance and other needs, ISG says. With the growing use of AWS as a core IT platform, demand for consulting services from providers that are partnered with AWS is also increasing.\n</p><p>\nThe 2021 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 AWS Ecosystem Partners report for Australia evaluates the capabilities of 38 providers across six quadrants: AWS Managed Services, AWS SAP Workloads, AWS Data Analytics and Machine Learning, AWS Internet of Things (IoT) Services, AWS Migration Services, and AWS Consulting Services.\n</p><p>\nThe report names Accenture, Deloitte and TCS as Leaders in all six quadrants. It names DXC Technology, Infosys and Versent as Leaders in four quadrants each and AC3 and Cognizant as Leaders in three quadrants each. HCL and Wipro are named as Leaders in two quadrants each, and Datacom, Intellify and Telstra Purple are named as Leaders in one quadrant each.\n</p><p>\nIn addition, Slalom is named as a Rising Star\u2014a company with a \u201cpromising portfolio\u201d and \u201chigh future potential\u201d by ISG\u2019s definition\u2014in two quadrants. CMD, Datacom and Lemongrass are named as Rising Stars in one quadrant each.\n</p><p>\nA customized version of the report is available from <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcs.com%2Ftcs-leader-aws-services-australia&amp;esheet=52566651&amp;newsitemid=20220123005018&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TCS&amp;index=3&amp;md5=b3aa8bc9eeeda16b5a28a926f7ffbb1e\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">TCS</a>.\n</p><p>\nThe 2021 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 AWS Ecosystem Partners report for Australia is available to subscribers or for one-time purchase on this <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.isg-one.com%2Freportaction%2FQuadrant-AWS-Australia-2021%2FMarketing&amp;esheet=52566651&amp;newsitemid=20220123005018&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=webpage&amp;index=4&amp;md5=ff7419540daf4b7432b5f634a2b5bd25\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">webpage</a>.\n</p><p>\n<b>About ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Research</b>\n</p><p>\nThe ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Quadrant research series is the only service provider evaluation of its kind to combine empirical, data-driven research and market analysis with the real-world experience and observations of ISG's global advisory team.
