I'm excited to be on people's Christmas playlists because it's such a magical time of the year and getting to be part of the soundtrack during such an intimate family and friend holiday season is a real honor. It's truly special and really sacred.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is one of our favourite times of the year, where we're able to bring our customers around the world a collection of brand-new music and programming to celebrate the holiday season,\" said <span>Ryan Redington</span> , VP of music industry, Amazon Music. \"It's always thrilling to see a spike in the charts for Christmas classics, and our Amazon Original songs for the holidays\u2014from incredible artists like <span>Camila Cabello</span> , <span>Summer Walker</span> , and George Ezra\u2014introduce a contemporary take on the familiar favourites that our customers love to stream. In fact, in the last three years, the top 25 most popular holiday Amazon Original songs, from artists such as <span>Katy Perry</span> , John Legend, and <span>Justin Bieber</span> , have surpassed 750 million streams globally.\"</p>\n<p>Amazon Music is celebrating the holidays across the globe, with new music arriving from international talent to light up the season. From the UK, singer/songwriter <span>George Ezra</span> will debut \"Come on Home for Christmas,\" his beautifully reworked take on <span>Charles Brown's</span> \"Please Come Home for Christmas.\" British Amazon Music Breakthrough artist <span>Olivia Dean</span> , Chinese pianist <span>Lang Lang</span> , and German pop-singer and songwriter <span>Sarah Connor</span> have each recorded their own reimagined versions of <span>Nat King Cole's</span> timeless classic, \"The Christmas Song.\" In addition, Latin pop-rock trio Reik will debut their rendition of \"Last Christmas,\" and <span>Marcos Witt</span> will premiere a Spanglish version of \" <span>Noche de Paz</span> (Silent Night) / <span>Santa la Noche</span> (O Holy Night)\" with his daughter, <span>Elena Witt-Guerra</span> . From <span>Mexico</span> , singers Mar\u00eda Le\u00f3n, Paty Cant\u00fa, and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 <span> team up for a rendition of <span>Mariah Carey's</span> \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" out on <span>November 19</span> . Spanish pop band La Oreja de Van Gogh will also delight customers with their version of \" <span>Blanca Navidad</span> .\"</span></p>\n<p>\"Doing jingle bell rock was super exciting since it's such a classic Christmas tune,\" said <span>Alessia Cara</span> . \"Given the fact that there are so many great versions of it, me and Jon wanted to make sure ours was fresh and fun but still true to the original. We added some very '50s-style harmonies to make it feel all the more classic and nostalgic. I love the way it turned out.\"</p>\n<p>\"When I first heard I was going to do an Amazon Original, I immediately thought of the Marvin Gaye version of 'Purple Snowflakes,'\" said <span>Leon Bridges</span> . \"It's one of my favourite Christmas songs and I love the classic stuff\u2026 but this one has a little bit more soul to it. There aren't too many renditions of this song and I wanted to kind of put my own spin on it as far as figuring out the arrangement and give it the <span>Fort Worth, Texas</span> approach.\"</p>\n<p>\"Writing original Christmas songs is difficult, because there's already so many good songs that exist and ... you feel like everything's already been said,\" shared Dan + Shay. \"One day we sat down to write our song and it sort of poured out of us\u2014it was just the soundtrack for folks going out, families, friends going to a Christmas tree farm, or going to a store down the street and picking out a Christmas tree. We're so excited about it and hopefully it brings a little joy this holiday season.\"</p>\n<p>\"Above all, it is important to give thanks! Music has given me everything, and I am grateful and humbled to use it to give back to my fans,\" said Sech. \"'Carta Navide\u00f1a' is an original song inspired by the holiday spirit felt around the world. You can recognize the sounds often heard in the classics, but with my unique style and emotions. The lyrics express my fondest holiday memories and traditions. I hope it becomes a popular classic, too, resonating with fans and reminding them to create many happy memories and give thanks always.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to new holiday songs, Amazon Music listeners can explore hundreds of festive playlists and stations across artists and decades, including \"REDISCOVER Mariah Carey Christmas,\" \"Christmas Past,\" and \"Christmas Present,\" and a host of new programmed destinations. \"Merry Mix\" is a global playlist on Amazon Music featuring iconic holiday classics mixed with tomorrow's holiday hits.</p>\n<p>Amazon Music is also home to millions of podcast episodes and shows for the entire family to enjoy together, including <span>Little Stories Everywhere,</span> and <span>Wow in the World available on Wondery</span> .
