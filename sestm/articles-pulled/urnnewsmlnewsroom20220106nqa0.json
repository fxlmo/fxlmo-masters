(\"Doseology\" or the \"Company\"), a British\nColumbia-based diversified life sciences company developing mushroom-based\nhealth and wellness solutions, announces the successful soft launch of\nseven new adaptogenic mushroom products in the United States, and the\nupcoming launch of the product line in the Canadian market during the first\nquarter of 2022.\n\n     Doseology's new medicinal mushroom products have successfully\ncompleted test marketing with overwhelmingly positive ratings and reviews.\nBeing among the most comprehensive available on the market, they will help\nfill the growing demand for high-quality adaptogenic nutraceuticals. The\nnew line employs adaptogenic blends to improve on the single-extract\ntinctures commonly available. Blends have a higher market value because of\nincreased user benefits and development challenges.\n\n     The proprietary formulations make extensive use of natural mushroom\nfruiting bodies, pairing adaptogenic botanicals with vitamins for increased\nefficacy.  Significant research has shown positive effects of adaptogens\nwith respect to stress reduction, resistance to mental fatigue, and\nimproved attention capacity. The Doseology line combines adaptogens such as\nginger, turmeric, yerba mate, and several mushroom species, with proven\nfunctional mushrooms such as lion's mane, reishi, shiitake, maitake, royal\nsun, turkey tail, and others. These blended formulations deliver enhanced\nhealth and wellness benefits over single-ingredient products.\n\n     The new product line addresses the functional mushroom market,\nprojected to grow to US$572 billion globally by 2028 with a CAGR of 6.1\npercent (Data Bridge Market Research). Products in the new Doseology line\naddress different segments of the market, including mood and depression,\nattention and focus, sleep and recovery, and anxiety.\n\n     In preparation for the Canadian launch, Doseology has received six\nNatural Product Number (NPN) licenses from Health Canada. The Company is\ncurrently exploring Canadian distribution channels, which is planned to\ninclude Amazon.ca. With US$7.14 billion in net sales (Statista, 2020),\nAmazon.ca is by a wide margin Canada's largest online retailer. The\nCompany's direct marketing focus will enable it to quickly reach consumers\nwho can benefit most, provide an engaging customer experience, and\nestablish long-term relationships to maximize revenue.\n\n     Daniel Vice, Doseology CEO and Director, comments, \"After many months\nof product development, testing, and regulatory approval, we are pleased to\nfinally launch our products in the U.S. market, and soon in Canada. By\nincorporating the nutrient-dense fruiting bodies of functional mushrooms\nand natural health-promoting adaptogens, our products were designed to\noptimize the user experience which reflects our commitment to deliver\nhigh-quality, natural solutions to improve physical &amp; mental health.\"\n\n     A core element of the Company's mission is developing and providing\npsychedelic treatments for restoring mental health. Once the regulatory\nframework has been established, Doseology's product line will form the\nfoundation for psilocybin-based therapeutics, creating an entirely new\nmarket and fulfilling the Company's vision of better mental health and\nwellness for millions globally.\n\n     Doseology has completed its application with Health Canada to become a\n\"Licensed Dealer\" under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada),\nwhich would permit the production of psychedelic compounds including\npsilocybin and psilocin, and mark a significant milestone in achieving the\nCompany's vision.\n\n     These announced developments will give consumers better access to the\nhealing power of medicinal mushrooms, and bring Doseology closer to\ndelivering innovative wellness solutions and mental health therapies.\n\n     Learn more about Doseology's medicinal mushroom product line at\ndoseology.com.\n\n     On Behalf of the Board of Directors\n     Daniel Vice\n     Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     Doseology Sciences Inc.\n\n     About Doseology Sciences Inc.\n\n     Doseology Sciences Inc. is a British Columbia-based diversified life\nsciences company, on a mission to reimagine mental health therapies through\ninnovation, technology and sustainability.
