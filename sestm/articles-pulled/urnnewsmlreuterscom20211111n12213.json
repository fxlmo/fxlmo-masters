(0915 EST/1415 GMT)</p><p>Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, is out with some comments on EV maker Rivian's <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=RIVN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"RIVN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">RIVN.O</a> IPO on Wednesday. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2S22TD\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2S22TD\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>As a \"one-time Wall Street auto analyst,\" Colas says he was very interested to see Rivian go public and achieve an $86 billion market cap out of the gate, which he says put it in same league as General Motors (also $86 billion) and more than Ford $77 billion), even if it is only 30% of Toyota ($289 billion).</p><p>However, Colas believes that the more useful comp may be Rivian's market cap being around 8% of Tesla's equity valuation ($1.1 trillion market cap). <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2S22PM\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2S22PM\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>Colas thinks that on the one hand, this all seems reasonable given that Rivian has Amazon and Ford as investor/partners. He adds that we\u2019ve seen Rivian's products \"firsthand, and they are truly compelling.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Colas notes that Tesla did not attain an $80 billion market cap until early 2020, when it was producing 100,000 vehicles per quarter. Meanwhile, Rivian is just starting to ship its first customer vehicles now.</p><p>DataTrek's takeaway is that Rivian's valuation makes it a legitimate option for institutional investors who have previously only had Tesla to play the electric vehicle space.</p><p>However, with Rivian now public, Colas believes it may allow for the dynamic where some investors may sell the \"old\" name and replace it with the \"new.\"</p><p>\"Tesla has been the only 'real' EV play in US equity markets for years. Now it has competition for the marginal investor. With TSLA still 2.1 percent of the S&amp;P 500 (5th largest holding), it will be interesting to see how this all plays out.\" </p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>***** </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>NASDAQ COMPOSITE: BIGGER BOUNCE OR BUNGEE JUMP? (0900 EST/1400 GMT)</p><p>In late August, the Nasdaq McClellan Summation (McSum), a breadth/momentum indicator based on advancing and declining issues, had fallen to its lowest levels, with the Nasdaq Composite <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=.IXIC\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\".IXIC\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">.IXIC</a> at all-time highs, since early-November, 1999! <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2PW0PG\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2PW0PG\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>Subsequent to this, the IXIC topped in early September and slid more than 7% into its early October low.</p><p>With this, the McSum, fell to its lowest levels since April 2020, before then forming a bullish convergence on a shorter-term basis, into the IXIC's early-October trough <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RH0SF\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RH0SF\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>:</p><p><br/></p><p><div class=\"tr-resource-ref\" id=\"b37b8175-522e-4c6f-b0d9-e7eebe342fa2\"><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/gdpzydmozvw/IXIC11102021.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5nZngudGhvbXNvbnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2dmeC9idXp6L2dkcHp5ZG1venZ3L0lYSUMxMTEwMjAyMS5wbmc=&amp;storyId=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20211111:nL1N2S21CN:3&amp;key=bd8b1022e09a24dcf6a9d1b60f9db6ac7b4a8cdfdfb148aa5af50622968b577bb3749539cf84cb1fed5187f9224152efe7c19ecf08b3091118d452884aabe4ac\"/></div></div></div></p><p><br/></p><p>From the Composite's Oct. 4 bottom, the index rallied about 12%, to new highs, before stalling on Monday.</p><p>On Tuesday, the McSum had recovered from a low of -3,829 on Aug. 20 to -615. That was a substantial recovery, but still shy of its -365 late-June high. The measure ticked down on Wednesday.</p><p>If its bounce is over, the McSum will roll over and break its 10-day moving average. Ultimately, if the indicator is to continue lower, there can be substantial downside given that its March 2020 low is at -6,207 and the support line now resides around -7,000. In that event, IXIC downside could be surprisingly large. A McSum test of the support line in early 2020 came with a more than 30% IXIC collapse.</p><p>If the IXIC can reverse back to the upside, and the McSum can surpass -365, there would be potential for greater gains given the February McSum high is at +1,967, and the resistance line from 2012 is now just over +2,000. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2S10XE\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2S10XE\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p>     </p><p>FOR THURSDAY'S LIVE MARKETS' POSTS PRIOR TO 0900 EST/1400 GMT - CLICK HERE: <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2S2172\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2S2172\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Terence Gabriel is a Reuters market analyst.
