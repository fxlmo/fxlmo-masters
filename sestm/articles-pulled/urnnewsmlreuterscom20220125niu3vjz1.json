It is unbearable that it has even been used on shoes. I have instructed the director-general of police (DGP) to take action by registering an FIR against the owners of Amazon.\"</p><p>\"Prima facie, this case appears to be a violation of the Flag Code, which is painful. Insult to the nation will not be tolerated at any cost,\" he added.</p><p>A police officer said the case was registerd on a complaint filed by a 26-year-old private firm executive Shubham Naidu and clarified that the case names the seller as the prime accused.</p><p>The exact details of the items considered offensive were not shared by the police.</p><p>When contacted, Amazon PR specialist consumer communication head Ritwik Sharma said they will revert on this.</p><p>This is the third time that Narottam Mishra has ordered the police to register a FIR against the e-commerce platform in recent months.</p><p>In November last year, a FIR was registered against Amazon after a seller was accused of selling marijuana on the website in Bhind district.
