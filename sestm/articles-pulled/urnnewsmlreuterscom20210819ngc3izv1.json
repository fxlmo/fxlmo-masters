Rather than simply offering the software, they provided a complete, bespoke end-to-end service helping us optimise at every turn. This included training, support, and advice throughout.\u201dAveva global strategic partners vice-president Marc Ramsay said: \u201cTogether with Schneider Electric EcoStruxure, the AVEVA System Platform supports Vale in realising the mines of the future through contextualised operations built on a collaborative, standards-based foundation that unifies people, processes, and assets across all of Vale\u2019s facilities for continuous operational improvement and real-time decision assistance.\u201dEarlier this year, Vale divested its stake in Vale New Caledonia (VNC), which operates the Goro nickel mine and a processing plant in New Caledonia, to the Prony Resources New Caledonia consortium.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 MarketLine</p></div>"}
