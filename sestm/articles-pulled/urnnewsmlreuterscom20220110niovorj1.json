The cover of the first English translation of Liu Xinwu's 1984 novel The Wedding Party might have you thinking this 400-page novel is a piece of light nostalgia set amid the old hutong alleyway communities of Beijing's ancient Drum and Bell Towers district (Gulou). Liu also dangles the lure of easy entertainment in the first few pages, telling readers the novel will deal with \"the mundane aspects of life\". And in many ways it does \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a wedding surrounded by fractious and often comical relations among neighbours, parents, children and in-laws. But these events and interactions are ultimately \"mundane\" in a similar vein to a Dickens or a Dostoevsky novel: beneath the seemingly inconsequential swirl jealousies, resentments and trauma.</p><p>It is 7am, Sunday, December 12, 1982. Auntie Xue is busy preparing a wedding celebration for her youngest son. Outside the hutong, life is changing in China: the Cultural Revolution is over, though its myriad reverberations echo through the alleyways. We are in the earliest days of Deng Xiaoping's reform era and witnesses to an interregnum, glimpsing what might imminently prove to be the best of times for ordinary people finally able to leave the worst behind. Ten years previously a hutong wedding would have meant \"handing out some candy and then calling it a day\". Now we are in a rapidly evolving world of opportunities. Think colour portraits from the China Photo Studio on Wangfujing, a hired car and chauffeur, an imported Swiss watch for the groom. But Auntie Xue, falling heavily into debt, is skipping medicines to buy beef for the banquet and Peony cigarettes for the guests. Making an impression has become expensive.</p><p>The novel includes a vast cast of widely representational characters. A chef, a Peking opera performer, a cadre, a professor, a student, a country girl come to town, a loud-mouthed opinionated granny, some wastrel \"hutong hooligans\" (young men of few prospects), all are classic Beijing types with their own place in the hutong, or as Auntie Xue says, \"every radish in its own hole\". And all with dreams and hopes, whether to make a genuine love match, a successful private cobblers' business, or a move away to a newly built apartment with its own bathroom and kitchen.</p><p>The Wedding Party is initially a lament for a more communal, \"authentic\" life before anonymous high-rise apartments sprout in remote suburbs. All Beijing life interacts within the hutong, but as Liu soon shows, the reality of hutong life can be cold, argumentative and claustrophobic. The perfect Petri dish for the novelist, Liu's initial semblance of nostalgia belies his insightful social commentary.</p><p>Hutongs have survived the vicissitudes of Beijing life since the Yuan dynasty, and still (just about) persist today. They have seen generations come and go, adjust and adapt. Recriminations do fester, vendettas certainly linger and passions are thwarted under the constant public gaze. The speed-of-light hutong grapevine spreads every piece of gossip, whether malicious, benevolent, true or false. And The Wedding Party (which won the prestigious Mao Dun Literature Prize in 1985) is a fully immersive experience, both in 1980s hutong life and the onset of an era in Chinese history we are living through still.</p><p>You embark on The Wedding Party (expertly translated here by Jeremy Tiang) much like you arrive at a celebration of extended family, friends and neighbours \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd with hope, joy and good humour. As events proceed there are dark moments and muttered grumbles alongside bitter memories of the past.</p><p>Liu also weaves in a subplot to show the continuity of life in these laneways, the eternal spats and fights, communities regenerating and adapting constantly to circumstances. He has his panoply of characters reflect their life choices and fates, concluding that the \"Bell and Drum Towers will remain as eternal witnesses to history and destiny \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd awaiting the next moment, the next day, the next month, the next year, the next generation\".</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 South China Morning Post.
