Amazon had \"suppressed the actual scope\" of the deal and made \"false and incorrect statements,\" the order added. <br/><br/>The regulator finds \"it necessary to examine the combination afresh\" and will keep the deal in \"abeyance\" till then, it said. <br/><br/>The deal suspension can impact Amazon's legal fight with Future. Last year, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries had agreed to purchase the retail, wholesale, warehousing and logistics businesses of the debt-loaded Future Group. However, the contract was delayed following a dispute with Amazon, after the U.S. retailer sought a freeze order from Singapore arbitration court.  <br/><br/>Amazon, which had bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons in 2019 and owns a 7.3% stake in Future Retail, challenged the sale of assets citing allegations regarding violation of contractual agreements.<br/>   - By Mukesh Jagota and Swastika Mukhopadhyay; mukesh.jagota@newsrise.org; 01166767709<br/>- Edited by Gourab Das<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2021 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
