The US sovereign curve sat flatter into the close, with front-end\n  yields adding as much as 11bps to hit the highest levels since the beginning\n  of the COVID pandemic in 2020.\n* This bolstering of a tighter policy outlook for the year pressured materials,\n  real estate and industrials stocks, putting the e-mini S&amp;P on the backfoot.\n* One standout sector, however, was consumer discretionary, underpinned by\n  Amazon, which surged over 10% after their Thursday earnings report put paid\n  to the pressure on the company's stock through early 2022.\n* Across Europe, sentiment was more uniform, with all continental markets\n  trading in the red.
