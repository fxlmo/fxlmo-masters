Guardian is part of Cellebrite\u2019s industry-leading DI Platform that offers customers an end-to-end investigative platform covering data collection, review, analysis, and management, supporting the widest variety of digital evidence from the crime scene to the court. <br/><br/>In addition to the United States and United Kingdom, Cellebrite also disclosed plans to deploy Guardian in AWS Data Centers in Canada, Singapore, and Australia before the end of 2022.
