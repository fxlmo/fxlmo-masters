Future told stock exchanges on Saturday the company was \"scaling down its operations.\"</p><p>Future's stores across India remained shut on Sunday as Reliance did stock-taking ahead of a rebranding, people familiar with the plans said.</p><p>\"We regret to inform you that currently stores are non-operational for 2 days,\" Big Bazaar told a Twitter user who complained about a closure.</p><p>Future's e-commerce mobile app and website were also not available for online ordering. </p><p>Reliance's move assumes significance as <span class=\"tr-strong\">it </span>follows failed efforts since 2020 to close a $3.4 billion deal to acquire the retail assets of Future, whose partner Amazon.com Inc <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> has blocked the transaction by citing violation of contracts. Future denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>Reliance had transferred leases of some stores of debt-laden Future to its name and sublet them to Future, but is now taking over as Future did not make payments. Reliance has offered store staff jobs on existing terms.</p><p>\"All employees, consumers, and everyone in India - we are all attached to the Big Bazaar brand,\" a Big Bazaar employee on Sunday. \"So you feel sad this is happening.\"</p><p>In blocking the Future-Reliance deal, Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal in which the U.S. giant invested $200 million in the Indian company. Amazon's position has been backed so far by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.</p><p>The move will upset plans of Amazon, which <span class=\"tr-strong\">hoped</span> one day to have a piece of Future's stores itself. <span class=\"tr-strong\">B</span>ut the U.S. firm appears to have little legal recourse, as store landlords appear to have independently given the leases to Reliance, said a lawyer familiar with the dispute.</p><p>\"Probably Amazon didn\u2019t think Reliance will be this aggressive,\" said the lawyer.</p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by William Mallard)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:aditya.kalra@tr.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">aditya.kalra@tr.com</a> ; +91-11-49548021; Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adityakalra\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://twitter.com/adityakalra</a>; ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
