Apple AirTag</p><p>Wallet-losers and key-misplacers, take note: You can grab a pack of four Apple\u00a0AirTags\u00a0right now on\u00a0Amazon. The quarter-sized\u00a0devices can fit anywhere from a wallet to a piece of luggage and will help you find almost anything after pairing it to your iPhone. If the AirTag is close, you can make it ring out loud. If it's farther away, you can use your phone to track the item. Throw one inside your phone case, under your bike seat\u00a0or put one inside your kid's backpack. You'll never regret it.\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Apple AirTag (4-Pack)\u00a0from Amazon\u00a0for $116</span> </p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">2. Ember Mug</p><p>It's easy to see how a temperature-controlled smart mug could be considered\u00a0a frivolous purchase. After all, for years now we've dealt with our hot drinks getting colder over time, and it's been fine. But then you actually get\u00a0a smart mug and you realize that having your drink be your preferred temperature at all times is pretty incredible. Take the plunge with the Ember\u00a0smart mug, which uses an app to control your beverage's temperature. One sip and you'll be won over, just like the almost 5,000 Amazon buyers who have given the mug an average 4.5 stars.</p><p><span>Get the\u00a0Ember Smart Mug from Amazon\u00a0for $99.95</span> </p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">3.

Over 70,000 Amazon ratings agree, with buyers giving the Cosori Max XL an average 4.7 stars and landing it atop Amazon's top selling air fryers list. If you're new to the air frying trend, the Max XL is a great place to start, and at just around $100, it's not that expensive a risk.</p><p><span>Get the Cosori Max\u00a0XL Air Fryer from Amazon\u00a0for $117.99</span> </p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">5. Barefoot Dreams Throw Blanket</p><p>Wildly popular and much adored, the Barefoot Dreams throw blanket has been an internet sensation since Chrissy Teigen raved about it in late 2019.
