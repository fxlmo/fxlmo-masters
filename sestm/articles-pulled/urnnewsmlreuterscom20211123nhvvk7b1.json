Normally listed for $249, these updated wireless headphones are now 32% off and come with MagSafe,\u00a0which means you can hold it near a MagSafe charger and it will snap firmly into place and start charging. We named the older model of the AirPods Pro one of the best headphones\u00a0we've ever tried thanks to the customizable fit of the buds and active noise cancellation that dampened environmental noise.\u00a0</p><p>That's just one of the best deals we found on Apple's popular headphones.
