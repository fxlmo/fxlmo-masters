Once the order is ready, Kitchen United employees simply scan a code to load the order into the locker. Customers, in turn, receive a unique pickup QR code to scan at the locker, take their order, and go on their way.</p>\n<p>\"Kitchen United has been using the Apex smart food lockers since the beginning of 2021 and we're impressed with how simple they are for both our employees and our customers to use,\" said Kitchen United Chief Operating Officer <span>Joy Lai</span> . \"Placing Apex smart lockers in high-traffic or centrally located sites allows us to bring even more convenience to our customers by offering them not only the ability to order from multiple restaurants via a single platform, but also the option of picking up their food in a simple and quick manner.\"</p>\n<p>\n<span>About Apex Order Pickup Solutions</span> Apex is a leading global provider of contactless smart order pickup solutions for use in foodservice, retail and B2B ecommerce.
