This new solution will enable Aruba customers to use the policy-based framework of AWS Cloud WAN to create advanced WAN topologies with integrated network segmentation that aligns seamlessly with the Aruba SD-WAN fabric. Now, all the advantages of network segmentation at the edge \u2013 in the LAN and WAN \u2013 can be extended from headquarters and branches across the AWS cloud.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As organizations increasingly utilize the cloud to host their business applications, they want the most flexible and modern SD-WAN solution that lets them achieve the highest return on cloud investments through better economics, control, reliability, and performance. Of equal importance, these organizations want to leverage cloud infrastructures like the AWS global network to build more flexible and secure enterprise WANs.</p>\n<p>With this latest development, Aruba now supports the widest range of integrations with AWS, making Aruba SD-WAN the cloud onramp of choice for cloud-first enterprises. This year\u2019s re:Invent marks the third year in a row that Aruba has been a launch affiliate for new AWS network services. In 2020, Aruba announced support for AWS Transit Gateway Connect and in 2019, Aruba launched API-based automation with AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager.</p>\n<p>Aruba\u2019s SD-WAN solutions, an integral part of Aruba ESP (Edge Services Platform), provide enterprises with a sophisticated, flexible on-ramp to AWS network services, allowing users to easily integrate their SD-WAN with a wide range of hybrid and multi-cloud services. Aruba\u2019s integration with AWS Cloud WAN provides complete support for cloud connectivity use cases which extend LAN/WAN network segmentation and traffic isolation from the edge to and through the AWS global backbone network.</p>\n<p>The benefits of LAN/WAN segmentation with AWS Cloud WAN include:</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li><strong>Improved network security from edge to cloud:</strong> Easily segmenting users, devices, applications, and WAN services into secure end-to-end zones in compliance with predefined security policies, regulatory mandates, and business intent provides consistent security policies and automated enforcement across the enterprise. Fine-grained LAN segmentation is translated to course-grained, VRF-like private network segments that extend across the AWS Cloud WAN.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li><strong>Faster spin-up of new branch sites and Cloud VPCs:</strong> The integrated solution, combined with the new \u201cone-click\u201d EdgeConnect VPC instantiation, automates network deployments, removing the complexity associated with manual, step-by-step configuration of the SD-WAN (IPSec tunnels, segmentation, route tables, and VRFs) with the common AWS Core Network Policy, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations can now extend policy-based network segmentation from the branch edge \u2013 which spans the campus, branch, microbranch, and remote worker solutions \u2013 into the AWS global network. Aruba SD-WAN integration with AWS Cloud WAN is enabled through Aruba Orchestrator and Aruba Central, making it easy to deploy, manage, and operate sophisticated WAN networks over AWS. Aruba Orchestrator now also supports automated \u201cone-click\u201d deployment of EdgeConnect SD-WAN instances directly into AWS VPC\u2019s. This new automation capability is seamlessly integrated with EdgeConnect\u2019s zero-touch provisioning workflow, and further simplifies the deployment and commissioning process for solutions using Cloud WAN.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis latest integration with AWS Cloud WAN changes the game for enterprises looking to maximize flexibility and reduce operational complexity while strengthening security posture within their cloud-centric WAN deployments,\u201d said David Hughes, chief product and technology officer at Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. \u201cIntegrations like these play an important role within Aruba ESP by enabling edge-to-cloud security for organizations as they adopt a Zero Trust SASE approach, while maximizing choice and flexibility as they implement their cloud strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The new Aruba SD-WAN solution with AWS Cloud WAN will be previewed at AWS re:Invent, with general availability anticipated in 2022.
