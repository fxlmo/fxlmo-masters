All three follow-up holes returned intervals of high-grade uranium mineralization, including massive uraninite mineralization in GWR-049.</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>\n<span>24.9% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> over 4.2 metres in GWR-049:</span> This drill hole was expected to intersect only a narrow interval of high-grade uranium mineralization along the northwestern boundary of the Phoenix Zone A high-grade resource domain, approximately 17 metres to the northeast of GWR-045. The drill hole intersected a thick interval of high-grade unconformity-associated uranium mineralization that, coupled with the results of GWR-045, is expected to expand the volume of the high-grade domain to the northwest outside of the extents of the same in the current resource model (see Figures 1 and 3).</li>\n<li>\n<span>3.6% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> over 3.5 metres in WR-787:</span> This drill hole was designed to test the extents of the high-grade mineralization discovered in GWR-049, by targeting the unconformity approximately 6 metres north of the mineralization in GWR-049 (see Figures 1 and 3). Mineralization in WR-787 was encountered at the unconformity, and included a mineralized interval grading 15.2% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> over 0.7 metres.</li>\n<li>\n<span>1.2% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> over 2.1 metres in WR-784:</span> This drill hole was designed to test the extents of high-grade mineralization discovered by drill hole GWR-045, by targeting the unconformity approximately 6 metres northwest of the mineralized intersection in GWR-045 (see Figures 1 and 2). The drill hole intersected perched uranium mineralization grading 1.2% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> over 2.1 metres, lying approximately 6.5 metres above the unconformity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>Andy Yackulic</span> , P. Geo., Denison's Director, Exploration, commented, <span>\n<span>\"The grade and thickness of mineralization in holes GWR-045 and G</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>WR-049 significantly exceeded what was predicted by the <span>Phoenix</span> block model. We believe these results will support an expansion of the volume of the high-grade mineralized domain in Phase 1 area of Zone A. Follow-up drilling encountered additional uranium mineralization that is also expected to be additive to future updates to the resource model for Phoenix Zone A. Of particular interest is the perched mineralization discovered in WR-784, which presents a style of mineralization that has not been previously encountered at <span>Phoenix</span> . As this intersection is located outside the extents of previous drilling at <span>Phoenix</span> , the potential exists to identify additional perched mineralization along the northwest margin of the Deposit.\"</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This press release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated <span>September 28, 2021</span> , to its short form base shelf prospectus dated <span>September 16, 2021</span> .</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Assay Results and Radiometric Equivalent Grades</span>\n</p>\n<p>The final assay results from the follow-up holes and GWR-045 were recently received, and confirmed the presence of high-grade mineralization in each drill hole. However, the Company is reporting radiometric equivalent grades (\"eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> \") for these holes, instead of final assay results, as significant core loss was encountered in each of these mineralized intervals.</p>\n<p>The Company may report results as preliminary eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> , derived from a calibrated downhole total gamma probe, and subsequently report definitive assay grades following sampling and chemical analysis of the mineralized drill core. In the case where core recovery within a mineralized intersection is less than 80%, meaning that samples may not be assayed with enough resolution to be considered representative of the nature and grade of the mineralization, radiometric grades are considered to be more representative of the mineralized intersection and may be reported in the place of assay grades. Radiometric equivalent probe results are subject to verification procedures by qualified persons employed by Denison prior to disclosure.</p>\n<p>For further details on the total gamma downhole probe methods employed by Denison, QAQC procedures and data verification procedures please see Denison's Annual Information Form dated <span>March 26, 2021</span> filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR ( <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3445334-1&amp;h=4012026118&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com%2F&amp;a=www.sedar.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.sedar.com</a> ).</p>\n<p>\n<span>Summary of 2021 Phoenix Expansion Drill Results</span>\n</p>\n<p>Figure 1 illustrates the location of the drill holes completed as part of the Company's 2021 expansion drilling at Phoenix Zone A, including the position of the five-spot commercial scale well pattern installed during the summer of 2021 (see Denison's news related dated <span>July 29, 2021</span> ).</p>\n<p>Figure 2 illustrates the previously defined extents of the Phoenix Zone A low-grade and high-grade domains, on section with the interpreted results from GWR-045 and WR-784.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 illustrates the previously defined extents of Phoenix Zone A low-grade and high-grade domains, on section with the interpreted results from GWR-049 and WR-787.</p>\n<p>The mineralized intervals from each of these drill holes are summarized in the table below:</p>\n<p>\n<span>Table 1 \u2013 Phoenix Zone A \u2013 Select 2021 Mineralized Intersections</span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Drill Hole</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>From (m)</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>To (m)</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Length (m) <span>(1)</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> (%) <span>(2,3)</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>GWR-045</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>406.95</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>415.55</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>8.6</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>22.0 <span>(4)</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>GWR-049</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>408.95</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>413.15</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>4.2</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>24.9 <span>(4)</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>WR-784</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>406.25</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>408.35</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>2.1</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>1.2</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>WR-787</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>411.40</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>415.90</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>4.5</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>3.6</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>including</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>413.00</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>413.70</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>0.7</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>15.2 <span>(4)</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p>\n<span>Notes:</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>1.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>As the drill holes are oriented vertically and the mineralization is interpreted to lie nearly horizontal, the drill intersection is interpreted to represent the true thickness.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>2.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> is a radiometric equivalent grade U <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> derived from a calibrated total gamma down-hole probe.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>3.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Composited above a cut-off grade of 0.1% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> unless otherwise indicated.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>4.</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Composited above a cut-off grade of 1.0% eU <span>3</span> O <span>8</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\n<span>Sampling and Assay Procedures</span>\n</p>\n<p>Drill core with anomalous total gamma radioactivity (&gt;300 counts per second using an RS-120 or RS-125 scintillometer) was sampled over 0.5 metre intervals. Sampling is undertaken on site by splitting the core in half, with one half submitted for analysis and the other half retained in the core box for future reference. Uranium chemical assays are performed by the Saskatchewan Research Council (\"SRC\") Geoanalytical Laboratories located in Saskatoon. Sample preparation involves crushing and pulverizing core samples to 90% passing -106 microns. Splits of the resultant pulps are initially submitted for multi-element ICP-MS analysis following partial (HNO3:HCl) and total (HF:HNO3:HClO4) digestions. Samples with \u2265 1,000 ppm U (partial digest) are re-assayed for U <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> using an ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited method for the determination of U <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> weight percentage. Pulp splits are digested using aqua-regia, and the solution is analyzed for U <span>3</span> O <span>8</span> weight percentage using ICP-OES. In addition to internal checks by SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories, the Company has rigorous quality assurance and quality control (\"QAQC\") procedures, including the insertion of standard reference materials, blanks and field duplicates. The assay data is subject to verification procedures by qualified persons employed by Denison prior to disclosure.
