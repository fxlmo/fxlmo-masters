(\u201cAmazon\u201d) (NASDAQ: AMZN), together with a subsidiary of Weber Inc. (NYSE:WEBR) (\u201cWeber\u201d), jointly filed a lawsuit against 12 defendants for selling products that illegally bear the WEBER\u00ae registered trademark in Amazon\u2019s store. The defendants attempted to offer counterfeit versions of the global grill maker\u2019s grill covers, violating Amazon\u2019s policies, infringing on Weber\u2019s registered trademarks, and breaking the law.\n</p><p>\nThe lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and alleges that the defendants conspired to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of their products and create a false affiliation with Weber. Amazon closed the defendants\u2019 selling accounts and proactively refunded the impacted customers.\n</p><p>\n\u201cIf counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they don\u2019t just break the law and violate the rights of companies like Weber, they mislead consumers,\u201d said Kebharu Smith, Director of Amazon\u2019s Counterfeit Crimes Unit. \u201cIn the rare instances when counterfeiters are able to bypass our enforcement tools and teams, we will find them and hold them fully accountable.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAmazon strictly prohibits infringing and counterfeit products in its store, and in 2020, Amazon invested more than $700 million and employed more than 10,000 people to proactively protect its store from fraud, counterfeit, and abuse. Amazon uses industry-leading tools to verify potential sellers\u2019 identities and ensure product listings are authentic, and Amazon\u2019s proprietary systems analyze hundreds of unique data points to verify information provided by potential sellers. In 2020, only 6% of attempted new seller account registrations passed Amazon\u2019s robust verification processes and listed products for sale. In addition, fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers.\n</p><p>\n\u201cProtecting consumers and our brand are top priorities for Weber,\u201d said Phil Zadeik, General Counsel of Weber. \u201cAs the world\u2019s leading company in outdoor cooking, we take tremendous pride in developing, manufacturing, and offering high-quality, durable, innovative products that meet or exceed our strict standards. And when that premise is jeopardized with counterfeit goods, we take action. We appreciate Amazon\u2019s partnership and their commitment to only offering authentic Weber products to those that love to barbecue.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThe court filings are available here:\n</p><ul
