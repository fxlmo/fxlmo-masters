The company's vision is to produce low-carbon electricity and achieve carbon neutrality across its portfolio by 2050. Digital transformation is critical to delivering EDF's vision, and to preserving the company's competitiveness. In addition, the French nuclear industry identified software solutions as a key step towards realising a new, safe and competitive nuclear sector.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            SWITCH to the next level\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            In 2018, EDF launched the SWITCH transformation programme. SWITCH was designed to overhaul its nuclear engineering operations to embed efficient processes and innovative operating models. Engineering and building a plant to EDF's Extended Producer Responsibility blueprint is a long-term project. EDF wished to select a trusted partner who is fully aligned with its innovative priorities. Having signed a strategic agreement with AVEVA, SWITCH will be able to accelerate its digital transformation agenda,\n          </p>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <p>\n            elevating nuclear engineering to the cutting edge of innovation and performance using AVEVA's Unified Engineering solution.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            Leveraging AVEVA E3D Design, EDF will elevate its engineering design tools to a new level of conceptional methodology using AVEVA's unique industrial software capabilities to support the SWITCH vision. By empowering EDF's teams with a trusted, data-centric solution, AVEVA provides complete digital continuity and boosts engineering efficiency, all founded on the Digital Twin.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            Analytics-led operational efficiency\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            In parallel, EDF also uses AVEVA Predictive Analytics and AVEVA's operational data management, PI System, to operate its power plants. Together, these solutions provide EDF's team with real-time operations information, enabling them to make precise decisions to optimise assets across the company's portfolio.\n          </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <p>\n          Image: A nuclear facility in the French countryside.\n        </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n                    <tr>\n                      <td>\n                        <p>\n                2\n              </p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td>\n                        <p>\n                Annual Report 2021 <span>| aveva.com</span></p>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </table></div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <p>\n                        <span>aveva.com |</span> Annual Report 2021\n            </p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                      <p>\n              3\n            </p>\n                    </td>\n                  </tr>\n                </table></div>\n              </div>\n              <div id=\"noodls_PartTextMsg\">\n                <p>\n        This is an excerpt of the original content.
