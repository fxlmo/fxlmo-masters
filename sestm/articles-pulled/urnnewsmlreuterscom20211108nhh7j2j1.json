Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Macy's, Inc. <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/M\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">M</a> and Amazon.com, Inc. <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMZN\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AMZN</a> .</p><p>A few weeks ago, <span>The Wall Street Journal</span> reported that luxury department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue (owned by Toronto-based Hudson's Bay Co.) is aiming to take its e-commerce division public at a valuation of $6 billion, sending ripples across the retail industry and making investors wonder if<span>Macy's</span>would do the same.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">For Immediate Release</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\"> Should Macy's Spin-Off Its E-Commerce Business? </p><p>The new $6 billion valuation for Saks.com is triple the assessment the unit received following investment from private equity firm Insight Partners earlier this year.</p><p>Many rightfully took this as a sign that other department stores' online channels, like Macys.com, could have similarly increased in value, especially after activist investor Jana Partners announced a stake in the department store chain last month; the firm sent a letter to Macy's board urging the retailer to separate its online and brick-and-mortar businesses and saying its e-commerce segment is now worth more than Macy's as a whole is today.</p><p>Given these two catalysts, it's not surprising that Macy's shares spiked 17.5% the day the <span>WSJ</span> report was published. The Covid-19 pandemic certainly changed the way we view the retail industry, as it highlighted which brands have the ability to weather unprecedented circumstances.</p><p>If Macy's were to spin off its e-commerce unit, it would be a major event for retail, reflecting how valuable online storefronts have become these days.</p><p>But it wouldn't be an easy feat.</p><p>Macy's still has hundreds of open stores across the country (compared to only a few dozen for Saks), so splitting the physical and digital businesses would present many logistical and operational challenges. Plus, management has yet to indicate that it's even considering such a move.</p><p>Wall Street analysts have also weighed in on the idea. Citibank analyst Paul Lejuez told clients that he didn't think a split made sense for Macy's, maintaining a sell rating and a price target of $20 on the stock. On the other hand, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen argued that even though a spin-off is unlikely to happen in the near term, Macy's e-commerce unit could be worth $40+ a share as a standalone business.</p><p>Investors, however, are clearly open to the idea. It's also important to note that Jana Partners has a history of endorsing mega retail deals; they were part of the crowd that pushed organic grocer Whole Foods Market to be acquired by<span>Amazon</span>.</p><p>Macy's stock has gained over 174% year-to-date, and its market cap now sits at almost $9.6 billion. Shares are still a bargain as well, currently trading at an 8.2X forward multiple.</p><p>The company is set to report earnings on November 18, which will give us an updated look at its online business performance as the ultra-important holiday season approaches.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Zacks Investment Research</p><p>800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p><a href=\"mailto:support@zacks.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">support@zacks.com</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.zacks.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.zacks.com</a> </p><p>Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
