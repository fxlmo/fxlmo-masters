(Photo: Business Wire)</p></div><p>\nDale Merrill, FranklinCovey Global Managing Director, Sales Performance, said, \u201cWhat is it that works for salespeople to stand out from their competitors and sell more? Every day, they\u2019re competing with top salespeople in their industry for the same customers. And, for each sales opportunity there\u2019s only one winner. This book highlights how to go from being just one of the crowd to the superior choice.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThe author team spent six years of intensely focused research which included live sales simulations with more than 2,800 sales professionals from global companies in 135 countries. They discovered that most sales professionals and consultants believed they were doing a great job in their client interactions. Yet, 70 percent of the time, client executives felt those meetings were a waste of time.\n</p><p>\nOverwhelming evidence shows that the inability of salespeople to stand out is a pervasive issue with costly consequences. In working with sales research firm, Primary Intelligence, the author team also analyzed the results of surveys/interviews with more than 5,000 B2B decision makers on deals. They found that average win rates were a dismal 17 percent for deals above $100,000 across multiple industries globally (win/loss analysis). And, in a second set of surveys/interviews, which included more than 14,500 B2B decision makers, buyers saw no difference between vendors 42 percent of the time (differentiation analysis).\n</p><p>\nAnd the sales environment has only intensified. COVID-19 massively accelerated the tectonic shift from live to virtual (i.e., live-online) selling, which is here to stay. A recent Bain survey that found that 80 percent of buyers and sellers believe there will be a sustained increase in virtual interactions.\n</p><p>\nScott Savage, FranklinCovey Managing Director, said, \u201cIn the new, hybrid live-online and in-person world, the classic techniques of selling are much less effective, sales pipelines are languishing, and buyer-seller interactions look and feel very different. Buyers can\u2019t tell the differences between one salesperson\u2019s offerings and another\u2019s because everyone looks and sounds the same and competition is intense. Many salespeople aren\u2019t getting first meetings or they\u2019re conducting plenty of additional meetings that go nowhere, and they aren\u2019t winning enough business.\u201d\n</p><p>\nAs sales thought leaders and practitioners, the authors and their colleagues at the FranklinCovey Sales Performance Practice advise salespeople representing many of the top technology, consulting, and professional services organizations across the globe. They\u2019ve defined the three most frustrating struggles most salespeople have in common, as it relates to standing out.\n</p><ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>\nHow can I come up with differentiated messages for my clients?\n</li>\n<li>\nHow do I pull the messages together into a cohesive set of stories?\n</li>\n<li>\nHow will I share these stories with clients in a compelling way?\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nJennifer Colosimo, FranklinCovey President, Enterprise Division, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve helped thousands of salespeople overcome these struggles and gain confidence in their ability to craft, shape, and deliver compelling messages that enable them to stand out from the start to the finish of their sales cycles. We\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours with client executives discussing, debating, testing and learning together how salespeople could become \u2018Strikingly Different.\u2019 We discovered a simple formula for achieving compelling contrast that thousands of highly successful sales professionals are practicing in client interactions to close business.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<b><span><span class=\"bwuline\">The Strikingly Different Selling Formula</span></span></b>\n</p><ol class=\"bwlistdecimal\">\n<li>\nRelevant: Focus on what matters most to the client.\n</li>\n<li>\nDistinct: Show something different and better than the competition or status quo.\n</li>\n<li>\nMemorable: Make sales messaging \u201csticky\u201d: easy to share and hard to forget.\n</li>\n</ol><p>\nThe authors bring this formula to life through six vital skills top sales performers use to stand out from competitors to win the sale much more often, whether in a live environment or in online sales interactions on video conference platforms.\n</p><p>\n<b><span><span class=\"bwuline\">The 6 Vital Skills Top Sales Performers Use to Stand Out and Sell More</span></span></b>\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 1: Capture Attention with a Verbal Billboard</span></b> \u2013 Use a verbal billboard. It\u2019s the core message for the client. Think and speak in headlines, link to the client\u2019s goals and issues, and show \u2018From-To\u2019 client outcomes. Ensure your billboard tells an easy-to-follow story that is compelling, easy to share and hard to forget.\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 2: Create Excitement with Movie Trailers</span></b> \u2013 Use movie trailers (brief verbal/written communication) to excite the client or prospect to want to meet with you; intrigue them at the start of the meeting or proposal, so they actively engage in a peer-to-peer dialogue with you; and end the meeting with increasing momentum, earning you an invitation for another meeting.\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 3: Build Confidence with Flashbacks and Flashforwards</span></b> \u2013 Use flashbacks (success stories) on how you\u2019ve helped other clients by vividly and succinctly sharing how a similar client\u2019s outcomes were different and better than what they were previously doing, thanks to your experience in partnering on a solution. Use flashforwards to paint an exciting vision of future events and critical milestones to get to a successful outcome.\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 4: Become Essential with \u201cWhy Us!\u201d Differentiators</span> </b>\u2013<b> </b>Use differentiators to highlight unique differences to help the client see why those differences matter. Include a point of comparison for each difference; briefly describe a unique aspect of what you do that will make a real difference to the client; and explain why each difference will help the client achieve different and better outcomes.\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 5: Get Curious and Find the Gaps</span> </b>\u2013 Discover gaps in the sales process by structuring a conversation to deepen your understanding. Conduct a critical discovery dialogue that identifies the client\u2019s real needs, issues, and motivators. Find messaging gaps by shifting conversations from you talking about your solution to mutual exploration of business problems or results the client is trying to solve or achieve.\n</p><p>\n<b><span class=\"bwuline\">Skill 6: Navigate Traffic Lights and Close the Gaps</span></b> \u2013 Navigate through client questions, pushbacks, challenges, objections and concerns and resolve them with empathy. Engage in real human-to-human dialogue to close gaps and complete the sales process.\n</p><p>\nThese skills will help any sales professional overcome the challenges of standing out in any environment, including the live-online world and in-person interactions. The author team knows how difficult it is to stand out in both worlds.\n</p><p>\nRandy Illig, FranklinCovey Global Sales Performance Practice Leader, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all tried, failed, and succeeded in both settings. We\u2019ve hit and missed sales targets, mastered the online sales environment, and led teams in the pursuit of greatness. This book will change everything you know about sales, how you think, and what you say and do, resulting in shorter sales cycles, better opportunities, stronger client relationships, and bigger sales results.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<b><span><span class=\"bwuline\">Implementing Strikingly Different Selling in An Organization</span></span></b>\n</p><p>\nFranklinCovey\u2019s <span>Strikingly Different Selling </span>system (SDS) is complimentary to and integrates easily with all sales methodologies and approaches.
