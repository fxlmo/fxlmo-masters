Getting novel business models into public hands is the difference between 5-7 percent long-run annual returns and +10 percent, she says.</p><p>Rabe notes that more companies are expected to list soon, including electric car maker Rivian <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=RIVN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"RIVN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">RIVN.O</a>, business communication platform Weave <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=WEAV.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"WEAV.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">WEAV.N</a> and fintech NerdWallet Inc <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=NRDS.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"NRDS.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">NRDS.O</a>.</p><p>     \"Bottom line: The IPO window is wide open and should be for the foreseeable future, especially with US equities continuing to reach record highs,\" Rabe writes.</p><p>In addition, while financials continue to have the lowest valuations of any S&amp;P 500 sector, she says, more innovative financial platforms going public is encouraging.</p><p>Indeed, NerdWallet's shares are soaring more than 60% on Thursday in the personal finance firm's strong market debut. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2RV3LG\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2RV3LG\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>Next week, Rivian, backed by both Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> and Ford Motor Co <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=F.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"F.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">F.N</a>, looks to raise more than $8 billion in one of this year's most hotly anticipated IPOs. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RS2GB\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RS2GB\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>       </p><p>(Lance Tupper)</p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>EUROPE\u2019S FOURTH ALL-TIME HIGH: WHAT\u2019S NEXT?
