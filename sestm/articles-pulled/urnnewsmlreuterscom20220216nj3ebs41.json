Save $40: This widescreen tablet</big> </p><p>The Amazon\u00a0Fire HD 10\u00a0tablet usually starts from $149.99, but you can get one for 27% off right now, bringing the price down to $109.99. We ranked the Fire HD 10 as one of the best tablets we've ever tested thanks to its large display, which is capable of playing 1080p-resolution videos with reasonably true colors and black levels, and the relatively quick charging time. Though it doesn't have the strongest app collection compared with the competition from Apple and Google, it's hard to beat its current discounted price.</p><p><span>Get the Amazon Fire HD 10 from $109.99 (Save $40)</span> </p><p><big>2. 10% off: One of our favorite air fryers\u00a0</big> </p><p>Air fryers make the daily kitchen\u00a0workload a whole lot easier, but some of the best models can be pretty pricey.

The Max XL is our pick for the best affordable air fryer thanks to its digital controls with preset cooking programs for whatever you're in the mood for. Not only does it prepare crispy french fries, but its parts are also dishwasher safe.</p><p><span>Get the Cosori 5.8-Quart Max XL Air Fryer from $107.94 (Save $12.05)</span> </p><p><big>3. 43% off: This stain-removing\u00a0water flosser</big> </p><p>Bring some extra shine to your teeth with the Waterpik WF 05 water flosser.

We picked the C920x as one of the best webcams we've ever tried for its display of sharp images and video quality, with our tester saying she could see the rims of her glasses in crisp focus. It's also got a hard plastic shell that we felt to be strong and durable, along with a layer of glass protecting its lens.\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Logitech C920x Pro HD Webcam for $59.99 (Save $10)</span> </p><p><big>5. 17% off: This compact Bluetooth speaker</big> </p><p>Taking your favorite songs on the go with you is now easier (and more affordable!) than ever with the Bose SoundLink Micro.
