We loved the incredible contrast and picture quality this OLED panel delivers, the sheer number of features it offers (including Dolby Vision and a 120Hz refresh rate) and its eye-catching design. If you're looking to invest in the best possible home theater experience, the LG C1 starts for as low as $1,296 in its 55-inch size, a $203 discount from its usual price of $1,499.99. (It's slightly cheaper in its 43-inch size, though not on sale, at $1,096.99.)</p><p><span>Get the LG OLED C1 Series Alexa Built-in 4K Smart TV from $1,096.99 (Save $203 to $903)</span> </p><p><big>2.\u00a0Less than $55: This updated hair dryer brush</big> </p><p>Make your morning hair styling routine easier than ever with the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus. Typically listed for $69.99, this hair dryer and volumizer can be yours for $52, or 26% off. The Plus is actually an upgraded model of one of our favorite hair tools, the Revlon One-Step hair dryer and volumizer hot air brush (from $34.88), which dried our locks from root to tip with minimal effort. The Plus 2.0 has a slimmer design than its predecessor and a detachable barrel while also adding a medium setting to its low, high and cool heat modes for more styling options.</p><p><span>Get the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush for $52 (Save $17.99)</span> </p><p><big>3.\u00a0Up to 54% off: These compact memory storage devices</big> </p><p>Whatever you need to be transferred from your phone, camera or computer, these select memory storage devices on sale at Amazon today can save it.

Typically listed for $349.95, you can pick up\u00a0these wireless music machines in seven vibrant colors for an eye-popping 50% off, or $174.95. We found the Studio3 to be one of the best over-ear wireless headphones for bridging the gap between a flat, studio-like audio profile with more emphasis on bass and a hefty set of ear cups you can still wear on the go. Its W1 chip can pair the headphones with any Apple or iOS device, while the built-in active noise cancelation drowns out annoying sounds like train rumblings and the hums of an air conditioner.</p><p><span>Get the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-Ear Headphones for $174.95 (Save $175)</span> </p><p><big>5.\u00a0Less than $900: Our favorite laptop</big> </p><p>The 2020 MacBook Air is the best laptop we've ever tried, having wowed us with the speed of its M1 processing chip and near-13-hour battery life\u00a0on top of\u00a0the aluminum chassis and Retina screen we loved in the prior MacBook Air model.
