The oldest victim was 98. Eight of the dead have yet to be identified, he said.</p><p>\"I still expect that we will find some more bodies. There is just so much destruction,\" Beshear said at a briefing, adding that more than 100 people remain missing.</p><p>In all, deaths across the states hit by the tornadoes totaled 88.

A total of eight people were killed, far less than initially feared.  </p><p>\"If you saw it in person, you would believe that's a miracle,\" Beshear said of the fact that more people were not killed.</p><p>By midday on Tuesday, nearly 25,000 Kentucky homes and businesses still lacked power, according to PowerOutages.us, more than four days after the tornadoes surprised people by striking unusually late in the year.
