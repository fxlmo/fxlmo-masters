By helping to grow the skill set of the international cloud development community, 2nd Watch empowers enterprises to accelerate their cloud-native fluency while advancing their digital transformation objectives.</p><p>\u201cOur DevAx program was designed to enrich in-house development teams that have company-wide goals to modernize their applications and workloads,\u201d stated Samm. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for teams with monolithic Java and .NET applications that want to modernize their applications and companies motivated to develop cloud-native apps. We\u2019re excited to officially launch the program today and look forward to partnering with our clients to grow their AWS skill sets.\u201d</p><p>2nd Watch, which has been recognized by AWS as a Premier Consulting Partner since 2012 and as an audited and approved AWS Managed Service Provider for its outstanding client experiences and depth and breadth of products and services, has extensive experience helping companies migrate to and use AWS.
