The AWS IoT         \nExpressLink modules will significantly accelerate design-in and time to market.\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nFor many businesses, connecting devices to the cloud remains challenging.      \nExisting solutions involve installing and maintaining dedicated software to    \nmanage connectivity on the devices. In addition, many legacy devices are too   \nresource-constrained to accommodate the additional code required to enable     \ncloud connectivity. To solve these challenges, these two modules were selected \nby EDN, Inc. for their gardening products:                                     \n                                                                               \n\"We were looking for a quick and effective way to enable robust cloud          \ncapabilities for our indoor growing platform. From past experience we knew that\ndoing so adds significant risk in terms of time, money, and overall            \ngo-to-market execution,\" stated Ryan Woltz, CEO at EDN, Inc. \"IoT device       \nconnectivity is complex, forcing our team to either outsource the development  \nto a costly third party or allocate internal engineering resources, both of    \nwhich can delay innovative features and increase our time to market. With      \nu-blox's NORA-W2 and SARA-R5 AWS IoT ExpressLink modules, we can go from       \nprototype to production in days, with secure and reliable cloud connectivity   \nthat scales. The u-blox platform has become our strategic advantage, enabling  \nus to focus on what we do best-creating innovative products that make nature   \naccessible indoors.\"                                                           \n                                                                               \nThe u-blox AWS IoT ExpressLink modules are all about speed and simplicity.     \nPaving the way for rapid design-ins with no complex software to run and        \nmaintain on the device side, the modules are ideal for small to medium-sized   \nbusinesses targeting consumer and industrial markets.                          \n                                                                               \nFeaturing a simplified and highly abstracted command set, the modules can be   \nconfigured without requiring specialized competencies in IoT product           \ndevelopment, networking, and cryptography. Pre-provisioned to communicate with \nAWS IoT Core, they can connect to AWS securely, out of the box, with a few     \ncommands only and integrate with services in the AWS ecosystem.                \n                                                                               \nSupport for Wi-Fi and cellular communication                                   \n                                                                               \nThe two modules are the first Wi-Fi and cellular AWS IoT ExpressLink modules on\nthe market.                                                                    \n                                                                               \nThe NORA-W2 AWS ExpressLink module is a new u-blox module delivering Wi-Fi 4   \nconnectivity as well as Bluetooth low energy 5 connectivity (including         \nBluetooth long range). The compact module (10.4 by 14.3 millimeters) features a\npowerful dual-core central processing unit (CPU) for advanced customer         \napplications. It is available with an antenna pin or featuring a printed       \ncircuit board (PCB) antenna.                                                   \n                                                                               \nThe SARA-R510 AWS IoT ExpressLink module is a variant of the SARA-R510S LTE-M  \nand NB-IoT module. The power optimized low-power wide-area (LPWA) module       \nconsumes less than 1 \u00b5A of current in power save mode (PSM), making it ideal   \nfor battery-powered applications. The module is certified for multi-regional   \nuse.                                                                           \n                                                                               \nEasy access for new entrants in the IoT space                                  \n                                                                               \n\"With the NORA-W2 and SARA-R5 IoT ExpressLink modules, wireless devices can be \nconnected to the cloud in a snap,\" said Andreas Thiel, Executive Director      \nProduct Centers and Co-Founder at u-blox. \"By simplifying access to cloud      \nservices, AWS IoT ExpressLink knocks down one of the key barriers standing in  \nthe way of newcomers to the IoT space: complexity.\"                            \n                                                                               \n\"The decision to work with u-blox was a clear choice for us at AWS, as we knew \nthat their high quality modules targeting industrial and professional          \napplications would complement our wide range of software and cloud services for\nIoT.
