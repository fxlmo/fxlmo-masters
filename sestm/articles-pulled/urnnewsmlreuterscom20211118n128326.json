Two new stock indexes created by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Twitter will unravel the mystery on Thursday, measuring the performance of the buzziest companies for investors with an eye on social media influence.</p><p>Twitter <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=TWTR.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"TWTR.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">TWTR.N</a> has long played a central role for investors and traders to share stock tips, keep up with breaking company news and follow the latest musings from CEOs like Tesla's <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=TSLA.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"TSLA.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">TSLA.O</a> Elon Musk, who recently polled his 64 million followers on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RY0D7\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RY0D7\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Twitter Sentiment Index will measure the performance of the top 200 companies within the S&amp;P 500 that have \"the highest sentiment scores,\" based on how the social network's users are discussing the stocks, said S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.  </p><p>The companies within the index will be weighted by market capitalization. A second index will measure the performance of the top 50 companies with equal weight. </p><p>The new indexes come as tweets about finance are rising on the San Francisco-based social media site, particularly with the growth of cryptocurrencies. Finance-related conversations were up more than 26% in 2020 from the previous year, Twitter said.</p><p>S&amp;P DJI said it will measure the Twitter sentiment of S&amp;P 500 companies on a daily basis by analyzing tweets that contain a \"cashtag,\" a stock ticker feature that works similarly to hashtags, and scoring whether the tweets are more positive or negative.
