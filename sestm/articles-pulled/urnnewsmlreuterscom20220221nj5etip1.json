Normally listed for $130.89, this 4-quart round Dutch oven with a glass lid can be yours for as low as $99.95 in cherry red, black and white. We named the larger Staub cast iron 5.5-quart round cocotte (from $324.95) the best Dutch oven we've ever tested, so this smaller model is sure to impress with the tempered glass lid for optimal heat control and a multi-coat enamel\u2014which the brand claims is resistant to chips, scratches and discoloration. The pot is designed for searing, boiling, deep-frying, braising and more in the oven, and works on both induction and traditional stovetops.</p><p><span>Get the Staub Cast Iron 4-Quart Round Cocotte from $99.95 (Save $5.62 to $107.65)</span> </p><p><big>2. 32% off: Our favorite affordable pillows\u00a0</big> </p><p>Sleep soundly with a new set of Beckham Hotel Collection bed pillows, the best affordable pillows we've ever tested. Usually selling for $49.99 for the queen size, this set of two plush pillows can be yours for just $39.99 today.\u00a0In testing, we found these cushions felt similar to down and offered optimal support for side sleepers. We especially loved that they were washable and didn't smell after opening (like other synthetic-fill pillows we tested).\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Beckham Hotel Collection Bed Pillows from $39.99 (Save $10 to $24)</span> </p><p><big>3. A 30% markdown: These excellent earbuds\u00a0</big> </p><p>We think the Apple AirPods Pro are some of the best headphones available right now, and you can get the updated version for under $180 right now. We love the Pros for the Active Noise Cancelation that dampened environmental noise and the customizable fit of the buds. This new version adds MagSafe, which means you can hold it near a MagSafe charger and it will snap firmly into place and start charging.

Save $150: Our favorite air fryer\u00a0</big> </p><p>Air fryers make cooking a whole lot easier, but some of the best models can be pretty pricey. Fortunately, our favorite air fryer, the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL, is currently selling at as much as 43% off at Amazon. Typically listed for $349.95, you can get the 4-quart fryer in black for just $199.95. In testing, we were impressed with this model's large capacity and loved that it made crispy foods (including family-size portions) without preheating. Although this air fryer doesn't have digital controls, making it harder to precisely set the temperature and cooking time, we still found it to be the most user-friendly air fryer we tested.\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL for $199.95 (Save $136 to $150)</span> </p><p><big>5.
