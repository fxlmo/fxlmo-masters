You bet it does. I don't think we're going to get that because I think this Fed has locked themselves in to a gradualist regime and a gradualist approach.\" </p><p>Concerns that the Fed will be forced to act more urgently could come back to the fore and be a headwind for equities, said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors.</p><p>The labor report was especially strong in \"re-opening\" sectors and together with wage gains continues to spur the inflationary \"wall of worry,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our fears that the first half of 2022 would be 'choppy' for markets are still holding and we are not out of the woods yet,\" Peron said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley said a Fed in tightening mode historically brings lower returns and great uncertainty for equities.</p><p>\"We remain sellers of rallies and of the view that S&amp;P 500 fair value remains closer to 4,000 tactically,\" the bank's research team said. The 4,000 level represents more than a 10% decline from the benchmark's close on Thursday.</p><p>The data made it clear that the labor market before Omicron was much stronger than previously believed, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. </p><p>\"It's very tempting to argue that the January data mean that all danger of an Omicron hit has passed,\" he said. \"We're a bit more cautious.\"</p><p>Shepherdson noted that the year-over-year wage growth jumped to 5.7%, but the three-month-on-previous-three-month annualized rate rose to a startling 7.7%.</p><p>\"No matter how bullish you are about productivity growth, the Fed can't live with that pace,\" Shepherdson said.</p><p>The report showed a jump in the labor participation rate to 62.2%, a surprise because Omicron was believed to have put a crunch on people seeking work.  </p><p>People are more willing to seek work, which should improve the overall labor market landscape if it continues and ease inflationary pressures, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.</p><p>\"The wage increases that we've seen are having the positive effect of drawing more people back into the job market,\" Price said, adding that \"it would alleviate some of the upward pressure on inflation.\"</p><p>The results also suggest that businesses have been more willing to hold on to as many seasonal workers as they could as a means of overcoming ongoing labor market tightness, he said.</p><p><br/></p><p>(Herbert Lash)</p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>U.S. STOCKS MIXED AS JOBS DATA STIRS THE POT (1009 EST/1509 GMT)</p><p>Major U.S. indexes are mixed in early trade on Friday.
