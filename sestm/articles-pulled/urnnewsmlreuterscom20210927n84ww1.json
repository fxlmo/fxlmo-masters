We have now completed our September semi-annual portfolio company reviews for Private Equity, Infrastructure and Scandlines, which have confirmed strong performance in the significant majority of our investments, including our healthcare investments, our retail and<br/>\n       e-commerce investments and our value-for-money companies.\n    </p><p>\n      Action's impressive performance has continued with sales, EBITDA and cash generation above budget for Q3 to date. YTD sales at over \u20ac4.5 billion are now over 20% ahead of last year with strong trading continuing across all geographies. We expect LTM EBITDA to the end of P9 to be over \u20ac760 million compared to \u20ac579 million at September last year and \u20ac506 million at September 2019. Cash generation has continued to be strong with a current cash balance of approximately \u20ac900 million. Action has now opened 150 stores in 2021, including its first five stores in Italy where trading has been ahead of plan.\n    </p><p><strong>A live webcast of the seminar will be available at 14.00.
