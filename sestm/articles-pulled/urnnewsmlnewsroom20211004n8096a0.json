The agreed consideration was up to \u00a327.8 million, of which \u00a320.6 million was to be paid on completion and up to \u00a33.6 million in each of March 2022 and March 2023, depending upon the performance of Parmenion. The Acquisition of the interest was conditional on approval by the FCA to the change in controller, which has now been received.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>On 1 October 2021 the Company completed the Acquisition and paid Preservation Capital Partners Limited (\"Preservation Capital Partners\") \u00a320.6 million. In addition to the consideration, the Company paid a further \u00a31.3 million to reflect their pro rata share of the costs incurred by Preservation in the acquisition of Parmenion, together with interest costs on the initial consideration from 1 July 2021.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since the Acquisition was announced, Platforum, a research consultancy, has published its latest quarterly analysis of investment platforms in the UK. Based on ten criteria, assessed by financial advisers, Parmenion ranked number one for platforms with Assets under Administration of less than \u00a320 billion, and second out of all platforms. Parmenion's proprietary technology and strong customer service has consistently seen it rated by Platforum as number one or two of all platforms each quarter since 2016.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Campbell Fleming, CEO of AssetCo commented:</span>\n</span>\n<span>\n<span>\"Parmenion is at the forefront of the digital transformation taking place within the asset and wealth management industry.
