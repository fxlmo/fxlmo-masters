The proceeds from the transaction were used to repay debt and related break costs of the holding company, Oystercatcher. The balance of the proceeds of c.\u20ac55 million was distributed to the Company.</p>\n<p>\n<span>On 17 November 2021, the Company agreed to invest c.\u00a3376 million to acquire a 100% stake in GCX and partner with GCX's management team to invest in a leading platform in the sector, with the ambition to increase the utilised capacity on GCX's existing routes as well as to add new routes and customers. GCX provides high-bandwidth connectivity, an essential service to a range of blue-chip customers including hyperscalers, telecommunications operators, new media providers and enterprises. Its 66,000km of cables span 46 countries from North America to Asia, with a particularly strong position on the Europe-Asia and Intra-Asia routes. Co</span> mpletion is subject to certain regulatory approvals and is expected mid-2022.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>On 3 December 2021, the Company agreed to acquire the 50% stake in ESVAGT owned by its co-investor AMP Capital for c.\u00a3258 million. Upon completion, which is expected to occur on 1 February 2022, 3i Infrastructure will hold 100% of the equity in ESVAGT. The acquisition will allow the Company to benefit from the rapid growth in the offshore wind market as many European governments and US states have set ambitious offshore wind build-out targets as part of their wider net-zero emissions plans.</p>\n<p>On 14 December 2021, 3i Infrastructure completed the acquisition of a 92% stake in SRL for c.\u00a3191 million. Management has re-invested to acquire the remaining 8% stake. The Company has provided a further \u00a383 million of debt financing to SRL with the intention of replacing this with third party debt in due course. SRL is the market leading traffic management equipment rental company in the UK and is headquartered in Cheshire. It owns a fleet of almost 13,000 items of traffic management equipment, which it rents to local authorities, utilities, contractors and traffic management companies from a nationwide network of depots.</p>\n<p>On 16 December 2021, 3i Infrastructure announced that it had agreed to invest a further c.\u20ac25 million into Valorem through a capital increase to fund its growth, raising the Company's stake in Valorem to c.33%. This funding will support the continued growth in Valorem's installed base of operational assets and development pipeline. Valorem is well positioned to benefit from France's ambition to increase renewable energy generation to 40% (from 27% currently) by 2030 and from ambitious renewable power development programmes in Finland and Greece. This investment completed on 17 December 2022.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Balance sheet</span>\n</p>\n<p>At 31 December 2021, the Company's cash balance was \u00a386 million, with drawings of \u00a370 million under the RCF. This cash balance was subsequently reduced by payment of the interim dividend of \u00a347 million in January 2022.</p>\n<p>In December 2021, 3i Infrastructure received lender approval to increase the RCF by \u00a3200 million to \u00a3600 million. In January, the Company obtained an additional one-year credit facility of \u00a3400 million from existing lenders. Aggregate credit facilities therefore total \u00a31 billion today.</p>\n<p>We have rolled the outstanding balance on the vendor loan note due from the sale of WIG in 2019. The Company received \u00a312 million of accrued interest in December 2021, leaving \u00a398 million of deferred proceeds due in December 2023 and callable on 6 weeks' notice.</p>\n<p>- Ends -</p>\n<p>For information, please contact:</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thomas Fodor</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Shareholder enquiries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+44 20 7975 3469</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Kathryn van der Kroft</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Media enquiries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+44 20 7975 3021</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>About 3i Infrastructure plc</p>\n<p>\n<span>3i Infrastructure plc is a Jersey-incorporated, closed-ended investment company, an approved UK Investment Trust, listed on the London Stock Exchange and regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.</span>\n<span>The Company's purpose is to invest responsibly in infrastructure, delivering long-term sustainable returns to shareholders and having a positive impact on our portfolio companies and stakeholders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>3i Investments plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3i Group plc, is authorised and regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority and is the investment manager of 3i Infrastructure plc.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This press release is not for distribution (directly or indirectly) in or to the United States, Canada, Australia or Japan and is not an offer of securities for sale in or into the United States, Canada, Australia or Japan.
