Ramana said. <br/><br/>The top court was hearing Amazon\u2019s plea challenging the Delhi High Court's January order, staying further arbitration proceedings before the Singapore tribunal against Future Group till Feb. 1. <br/><br/>The top court asked Amazon to wait for the lower court to wrap up hearing in a dispute with Future Group over its proposed sell out to Reliance Industries in a $3.4 billion deal. <br/><br/>\u201cIf we hear you (Amazon), then the proceedings before the High Court will become useless,\u201d Justice Ramana observed. The apex court adjourned the next hearing in the case to Mar. 9.<br/><br/>In 2019, Amazon invested $200 million in Future Coupons, the group\u2019s gift voucher unit, for a 49% stake, which gave the U.S. company a 7.3% foothold in flagship Future Retail. <br/><br/>However, the two companies fell out after debt-laden Future Group agreed to sell its retail, wholesale, warehousing, and logistics businesses to billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries, in August 2020. <br/><br/>Amazon tried to block the deal by getting a freeze order from Singapore arbitration court. Future Group\u2019s prospective sell out to Reliance threatens the U.S. company\u2019s dominance in India. The deal with Reliance is crucial for Future Group, which is on the brink of liquidation.<br/><br/>In December, the Competition Commission of India had suspended Amazon\u2019s deal with Future Coupons, saying the U.S. company concealed information while filing for regulatory approval. It accused Amazon of suppressing the actual scope of the deal and making \u201cfalse and incorrect statements.\u201d Earlier this month, NCLAT adjourned to Feb. 25 a hearing in the case filed by Amazon challenging the antitrust watchdog\u2019s revocation of the U.S. online retailer\u2019s stake purchase in Future. <br/>   - By Ujjwal Narayan; Ujjwal.Narayan@newsrise.org; 01166767700<br/>- Edited by Dhanya Ann Thoppil<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
