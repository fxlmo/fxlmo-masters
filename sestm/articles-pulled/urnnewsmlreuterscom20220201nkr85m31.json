The contract is worth approximately SEK 350,000 per annum plus\u00a0a commission based on sales via Amazon marketplace in Sweden.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"border:none;text-align:justify;border-color:inherit\"><span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span><span><span>The Dutch company Vertellis BV was started as a simple idea in 2016 as a question game over a Christmas dinner to create space for meaningful conversations.\u00a0To their surprise, something very special happened. They wanted to share this life-changing game and help as many people as possible.\u00a0They took the plunge and started a crowdfunding campaign to sell 500 games.\u00a0The result: more than 25,000 people placed an order!</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"border:none;text-align:justify;border-color:inherit\"><span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span><span><span>After that moment the company grew unprecedented.\u00a0Other people joined the team and the one game company in the Netherlands evolved into multiple products that are sold today in seven countries around the world. The team has had impeccable timing.\u00a0According to John LaRosa, market researcher and President of Marketdata LLC, The U.S. meditation market only was estimated to be valued at $959 million as of 2015, growing to $1.08 billion in 2016 and $1.21 billion in 2017. Average annual revenue growth is forecast to be 11.4%, to $2.08 billion by 2022.

During the past few months Ampilio with their international growth started to do marketing in the Netherlands to help foreign companies to launch in Sweden via Amazon.\u00a0\u00a0Vertellis contacted Amazon to hear more about the Martech company and after just one meeting realised that Ampilio were the right team for the job. Now Ampilio is running the entire operation for Vertellis in Sweden as well as a part of their marketing strategy for various other marketplaces.\u00a0</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"border:none;border-color:inherit\"><span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span><span style=\"tab-stops:36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt\"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Quote from Lars Blokdijk, CEO of Vertellis</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"border:none;border-color:inherit\"><span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span><span style=\"tab-stops:36.0pt 72.0pt 108.0pt 144.0pt 180.0pt 216.0pt 252.0pt 288.0pt 324.0pt 360.0pt 396.0pt 432.0pt\"><span><span><span><span><span>\u201c</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Vertellis believes Ampilio is the ideal company to lead\u00a0our business next chapter of growth and success in Sweden.
