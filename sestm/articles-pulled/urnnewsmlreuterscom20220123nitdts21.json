This includes the solution proposed in the term sheet between Samara Capital, and FRL, which contemplated an infusion of Rs 7,000 crore in FRL. Amazon has reached out to FRL in response to FRL\u0092s letter, dated January 21, where Kishore Biyani-led retailer had said that it was willing to accept Amazon's proposal, but under certain conditions, and any assessment of proposals will be subject to FRL\u0092s legal obligations.</p><p>Amazon has also sent the letter to top officials such as Ajay Tyagi, chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Ashok Gupta, chairman, Competition Commission of India (CCI), Sanjay Kumar Mishra, director, Enforcement Directorate and G Mahalingam, Whole Time Member, SEBI. The letter has also been sent to the top executives at Union Bank of India, Bank of India, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank, and Indian Bank.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>\u0093We are pleased that for the first time since our letter dated December 2, 2020, the independent directors are willing to consider Amazon\u0092s assistance in addressing the financial concerns of FRL,\u0094 said Amazon's letter to FRL's independent directors, dated January 22, which Business Standard has reviewed. \u0093We note that significant time has been lost on account of the unwillingness of FRL and the independent directors to consider potential solutions facilitated by Amazon in the past. Nevertheless, we reaffirm our offer to assist FRL within the framework of our rights under the agreements.\u0094</p><p>In this regard, Amazon confirmed that based on FRL\u0092s letter dated January 21, 2022, Samara Capital (\u0093Samara\u0094) has once again reiterated to Amazon that they remain interested and committed to lead and take forward the term sheet dated June 30, 2020, signed amongst Samara, FRL and the Promoters of FRL, which contemplates a purchase consideration of Rs 7000 crore (Indian rupees seven thousand crores Only) (\u0093Samara Term Sheet\u0094), with the assistance and cooperation of the independent directors.</p><p>\u0093Pertinently, the Samara Term Sheet provides for an acquisition of all retail assets of FRL, including the \u0093small store formats\u0094 comprising the \u0093Easy Day\u0094, \u0093Adhaar\u0094 and \u0093Heritage\u0094 brands, through an Indian owned and controlled entity structure led by Samara and supported by Amazon,\u0094 said Amazon\u0092s letter.</p><p>Amazon has said its engagement shall, in no manner, affect the binding nature of the injunctions passed in the Arbitration Proceedings and by Indian Courts (\u0093Binding Injunctions\u0094), including in relation to the alienation/transfer/encumbrance/disposal of FRL\u0092s retail assets. Such engagement will be consistent with Amazon\u0092s</p><p>rights under the agreements.</p><p>\u0093The transaction (\u0093Impugned Transaction\u0094) with the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (Reliance Industries Limited) group (\u0093MDA Group\u0094) will not proceed and not be acted Upon,\u0094 said Amazon in the letter. \u0093All assistance would be done through legally compliant structures.\u0094</p><p>According to sources, as early as June 2020, Amazon-backed private equity firm Samara Capital had signed a non-binding term sheet with FRL that entailed a Rs 7,000 crore investment. This was two months prior to Kishore Biyani-led Future Group announcing its Rs 24,713 crore (or $3.4 billion) merger deal with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) at the end of August 2020.</p><p>Amazon has told FRL that the transaction envisaged in the Samara Term Sheet would ensure availability of funds in FRL at the earliest, through an asset sale and an equity infusion, which would be a direct antidote to FRL\u0092s indebtedness.</p><p>As regards compliance of any structure with Indian law, Amazon said that this structure is also similar to the proposed acquisition of the retail and wholesale undertaking of the Future group (which includes FRL\u0092s retail assets) by Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited.</p><p>\u0093We understand that this entity has negligible business operations and whose parent entity Reliance Retail Ventures Limited has received at least Rs 47,265 crore (Indian rupees forty seven thousand two hundred and sixty five crores only) from various foreign investors,\u0094 said the letter. \u0093We also understand that this amount is proposed to be utilised to fund the acquisition of FRL\u0092s retail, wholesale and logistics assets.\u0094</p><p>In fact, the transaction involving FRL and constituents of the MDA Group, viz., Reliance Retail Ventures Limited and Reliance Retail and Lifestyle Fashions Limited, follow a strikingly similar structure. A comparison between the transaction structure under which Amazon made its investment and the structure involving Reliance Retail Ventures Limited and Reliance Retail and Lifestyle Fashions Limited is set out at Schedule I of the letter.</p><p>Amazon said it looks forward to the independent directors implementing the provisions set out in the Samara Term Sheet immediately, including by providing Samara the opportunity to conduct due diligence of FRL. If access can be provided in relation to all financial, tax, regulatory, operational, licenses, assets, encumbrances, material contracts, material liabilities, material litigations, material investigations and similar data which was shared with the MDA Group, Samara is ready to commence the due diligence exercise from Sunday, January 23, 2022, and complete it in an expedited manner.</p><p>\u0093Given your request that we assist on an urgent basis, in order to expedite the process further, it will help if all the existing due diligence report(s) prepared by or on behalf of FRL, are made available to Samara by Sunday, January 23, 2022,\u0094 said Amazon.</p><p>As in the past, Amazon said it remains available to facilitate discussions with Sumeet Narang, Managing Director at Samara. Further, as indicated vide its letter dated January 19, 2022, Amazon will facilitate the meeting with Narang on Sunday, January 23, 2022.</p><p>\u0093Please let us know the name and contact details of the authorised representative of FRL, who will attend the meeting and lead the engagement on behalf of FRL with Samara such that binding commitments can be arrived at within the shortest possible time,\u0094 said Amazon.</p><p>The letter said Samara and Amazon are confident that if the independent directors and FRL provide immediate access to the information and records of FRL and fully co-operate in the engagement/discussions, the transactions contemplated in the Samara Term Sheet can be implemented in an expedited manner. Further, Amazon along with Samara is open to engage with other stakeholders to find a viable solution at hand.</p><p>\u0093We also trust that you will cooperate in obtaining any regulatory approvals as may be needed,\u0094 said Amazon.</p><p>The letter noted that the MDA Group was allowed to conduct due diligence in preparation for its transaction from April 23, 2020, although the Impugned Transaction was finally entered into on August 29, 2020. Amazon said while it understands that the Impugned Transaction did not result in any immediate infusion of funds into FRL, it may be noted that if the Samara Term Sheet were implemented and the transactions as contemplated therein were consummated, FRL would have received up to Rs 7000 crore (Indian rupees seven thousand crores only) as contemplated in the Samara Term Sheet in the middle of September 2020 itself (i.e., within 2 months of executing the Samara Term Sheet), thereby obviating any imminent financial crisis or funding requirement purportedly faced by FRL.</p><p>\u0093We reiterate that FRL\u0092s retail assets cannot be alienated/transferred/encumbered/disposed of in any manner without Amazon\u0092s consent,\u0094 said Amazon. \u0093Pertinently, the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India dated August 6, 2020, does not mandate or require any sale of any assets of FRL.\u0094</p><p>Amazon has also requested FRL to consider to recover/generate up to Rs 4,303 crores (Indian rupees four thousand three hundred and three crores only) by unwinding the transactions relating to outstanding advances and security deposits as per the audited financial statements of FRL.</p><p>A query to Amazon and Future Group remained unanswered till the time of going to press.</p><p>FRL had set conditions to accept Amazon's proposal in a letter sent to the US e-commerce firm dated January 21, 2022. It said FRL is required to pay its lenders Rs 3,500 crore by January 29, 2022 and asked Amazon for its willingness to pay the amount by Monday, January 24, 2022. It asked if Amazon has authority to act on behalf of Samara Capital to finalise the transaction on its behalf. It said the management of Samara Capital should be owned and controlled by resident Indians to avoid any regulatory scrutiny. Amazon needed to provide confirmation by January 22, 2022 to accept the conditions including funding. FRL wanted written confirmation by Amazon about how FRL can service its dues and repay its lenders the total amount of about Rs 9,119.31 crore by March 2022. It told Amazon that its proposed infusion (of Rs 7,000 crore) for FRL in the letter is significantly less. FRL alleged that Amazon is making attempts to block Future to monetise its assets and repay lenders.</p><p>Response by Amazon\u0092s new letter dated January 22, 2022 to the conditions set by FRL:</p><p>Amazon\u0092s willingness to offer financial assistance to FRL including proposed infusion of Rs 7,000 crore led by an Indian-owned and controlled entity structure led by Samara.</p><p>The transaction envisaged in the Samara Term Sheet would ensure availability of funds in FRL at the earliest.</p><p>For compliance with Indian law, Amazon\u0092s proposal is similar to the proposed acquisition of Future\u0092s assets by Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited.</p><p>Samara is ready to commence the due diligence exercise from Sunday, January 23, 2022. It will help if all the existing due diligence report(s) prepared by or on behalf of FRL, are made available to Samara.</p><p>Available to facilitate discussions with Sumeet Narang, Managing Director at Samara,on Sunday, January 23, 2022.</p><p>The letter noted that the MDA Group (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani) was allowed to conduct due diligence in preparation for its transaction from April 23, 2020, although the Impugned Transaction was finally entered into on August 29, 2020.</p><p>Amazon is of the view that if the Samara Term Sheet implemented, FRL would have received up to Rs 7000, crore in the middle of September 2020 itself within 2 months of executing the Samara Term Sheet), thereby obviating any imminent financial crisis faced by FRL.</p><p>The letter reiterated that FRL\u0092s retail assets cannot be alienated/transferred/encumbered/disposed of in any manner without Amazon\u0092s consent. Otherwise, any proposal given by FRL to do so would invite appropriate consequences under law.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Business Standard Ltd.</p></div>"}
