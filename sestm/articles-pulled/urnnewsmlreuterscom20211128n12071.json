In the Netherlands, Dutch health authorities said 13 cases were found among passengers on two flights that landed in Amsterdam on Friday after departing South Africa.</p><p>Britain, Denmark and Australia have also found cases in recent days. While there are not documented cases yet in the United States, health experts said the variant could already be present.</p><p>Clark said consumers for now are forging ahead with reconnecting after prolonged periods of government-mandated lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions.  </p><p>\"People want to have a very thoughtful holiday season and want to prepare themselves to go back out into the world, if you will. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in their spending,\" Clark said.</p><p>Separately, he said the pandemic had induced people to reconsider how they structure their lives and work, contributing to hiring challenges.</p><p>\"People are looking at their lives so differently through the course of the pandemic,\" Clark said. \"People have evaluated what kind of jobs do they want to have, do they want to be in the food service business, do they want to be in retail, do they want to be in fulfillment, do both people in the family want to work? What\u2019s the life structure and setup?\"</p><p>While Amazon has successfully hired people during the current labor shortage, \"it is a challenge,\" he said. </p><p>Inflation, meanwhile, is not currently dragging down consumer spending, Clark said. Amazon had \"a record-breaking Black Friday,\" he said. </p><p>Shoppers are spending on apparel and home decor, an indication they are planning to come back together, he said. Spending on electronics has dipped, he said, after people invested in home offices for remote work.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Mike Spector in New York; Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper in London; Editing by Mark Porter)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:mike.spector@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">mike.spector@thomsonreuters.com</a> ;))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
