Rowe Price</b>, Coatue Management, <b>Franklin Templeton</b>, Capital Research Global Investors, Third Point, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment and Soros Fund Management have agreed upfront to invest a combined $5bn or nearly 60% of the sum sought (as disclosed on the cover of the filing).</p>\n              <p>Amazon, which already has a 20% stake after leading a $2.5bn funding round in July, is putting in $200m of that sum.</p>\n              <p>Rivian is also setting aside 7% of the offering for eligible US customers with a standing vehicle pre-order.</p>\n              <p>It has pre-orders for 55,400 of its R1Ts and R1Ss in the US and Canada from customers that paid a $1,000 deposit.</p>\n              <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpBMld6U9B0\">R1T</a> is a two-row five-passenger pickup truck and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jyp5t9XTR0\">R1S</a> a three-row seven-passenger SUV. More to the point and essentially underwriting/de-risking Rivian\u2019s near-term outlook, Amazon has ordered 100,000 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRDuLo3K6Q\">electric delivery vans</a>, the largest EV order ever.</p>\n              <p>Like any EV investment, the challenge is delivering on production targets. To that end, the company began deliveries of the R1Ts in September (and has now delivered 156 of them) and expects to have produced 1,200 of the former and 25 of the R1Ss by the end of this year.</p>\n              <p>Though yet to generate much revenue, Rivian has the tailwinds of EV euphoria blowing at gale force levels, making it somewhat removed from day-to-day market concerns such as the increasingly hawkish bent of central banker globally. Some of the other 16 IPOs on the road may not be as fortunate.</p>\n              <p>The other big news (earlier today) was Berkshire Hathaway-backed Brazilian online lender <b>Nu</b>\u2019s decision to set terms for its $3.2bn-plus NYSE/B3 IPO without yet formally launching the deal in the US/globally (look for it to price in December, see more below).</p>\n              <p>Meanwhile, 12 IPOs are slated to price this week, starting with <b>Allbirds</b>, <b>Claros Mortgage Trust</b> and <b>DeliMobil</b> tomorrow night.</p>\n              <p>Allbirds, the \u201csustainable\u201d shoemaker, is well oversubscribed with good one-on-one conversions. Some of the initial feedback is that the deal looks cheap versus Swiss running shoemaker <b>On</b>, whose shares are up more than 50% since it debuted on the NYSE in September.</p>\n              <p>Despite the risks posed by this week\u2019s FOMC meeting outcome and the likely start to its tapering of bond purchases, the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.2% higher today to start the penultimate month of a manic year, taking year-to-date returns to a sprightly 22.9%.</p>\n              <p>One boost to confidence in the overall IPO market is that chipmaker <b>GlobalFoundries</b>, currently holding down the spot as this year\u2019s third biggest IPO, has managed to overcome its poor debut last week to firm up in subsequent sessions. Today the shares rose 10.5% to $53.87, now comfortably above last week\u2019s top-of-the-range $47.00 IPO price after initially breaking issue.</p>\n              <h3>Nu wave</h3>\n              <p>Though Rivian is going to beat it to the punch,<b> Berkshire-Hathaway</b>-backed Brazilian digital bank <b>Nu</b> is expected to launch its much-anticipated $3.2bn US/Brazil IPO shortly after Thanksgiving for pricing in early December.</p>\n              <p>This morning Nu publicly filed terms with the SEC and Brazil's CVM and said it expected to commence the offering once they had completed their respective review processes.</p>\n              <p>The eight-year-old fintech intends to launch the offering on Monday, November 29 before pricing the offering in early December, sources involved in the offering said. Though December is often perceived as a risky time to price a big IPO, we would note that both <b>Airbnb</b> and <b>DoorDash </b>managed to do so very successfully in the final month of 2020 (and these were last year\u2019s two biggest IPOs to boot).</p>\n              <p>Nu is planning to sell a total of 289.2m ordinary shares, including some in the form of Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs), on the NYSE and Brazil's B3 (via the BDRs in the case of the latter).</p>\n              <p>Each BDR is equivalent to six ordinary shares.</p>\n              <p>The Brazilian/BDR portion of the IPO is aimed largely at Nu's customers and will be marketed in a R$9.35\u2013$10.29 range, while the range for the NYSE/global offering of ordinary shares will be $10\u2013$11.</p>\n              <p>Today\u2019s public filings follow Nu\u2019s confirmation last week that it had filed confidentially with both regulators.</p>\n              <p>The CVM requires the marketing terms to be publicly displayed for at least 20 days, longer than the 15-day period required by the SEC.</p>\n              <p>\"The Brazilian rules mean they have to have a filing with a range on it for a much longer period of time for the BDRs and they want their customers to get a lot of stock,\" one banker close to the deal said.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Morgan Stanley</span>, <span>Goldman Sachs</span>, <span>Citigroup</span> and <span>NuInvest</span> (Nu\u2019s investment banking arm) are acting as global coordinators.</p>\n              <p>Of course, Nu is taking a leaf from July\u2019s IPO of trading app <b>Robinhood,</b> which included a much bigger than usual retail/customer allocation (but didn\u2019t work out that well given Robinhood shares are down 8% from their IPO price).</p>\n              <p>The Brazilian offering would give Nu's customers (subject to a cap) the opportunity to get one BDR each. They can participate via the Nu mobile app from November 9 to December 5 (presumably much like Robinhood\u2019s IPO Access platform).</p>\n              <p>Nu, which in June raised $750m from a private round led by Berkshire Hathway at a $30bn, is seeking to go public at a $50bn valuation, leapfrogging other fast-growing Brazilian fintechs such as <b>PagSeguro</b> ($11.9bn), <b>StoneCo</b> ($10.5bn) and <b>XP Inc</b> ($18.3bn).</p>\n              <p>That would make Nu the third-largest company in Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index by market cap, behind only <b>Petrobras</b> and <b>Vale</b>.</p>\n              <p>Founded in 2013, Nu has 48.1m customers in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia that use its digital-only banking platform for spending, saving, investing, borrowing and insurance. Nearly 30% of all Brazilians over the age of 15 are customers.</p>\n              <p>In Q3 2021, Nu more than tripled revenue to $480.9m. On average, it added 2.1m customers per month during the third quarter.</p>\n              <h3>At your expense</h3>\n              <p>If you ever wondered in an idle moment whether it was possible to use a four-letter obscenity in an S-1, the answer is yes.</p>\n              <p>\n                <b>Expensify</b>\u2019s prospectus uses the word \u201csh-t\u201d on no less than four occasions, telling prospective investors that one of its rules for doing business is to \u201cget sh-t done\u201d.</p>\n              <p>We are not sure whether this constitutes a new non-GAAP metric, but somehow it got past the SEC\u2019s overworked reviewers.</p>\n              <p>The Portland, Oregon-based expense management software firm this morning launched its up to $243.3m Nasdaq IPO, a deal it also hopes will further its lofty goal (and just one of them) to \"save the world\".</p>\n              <p>That is quite the, er, ambition for a 13-year-old company with $141m of annualized revenue and just the latest in a long line of payments/software IPOs.</p>\n              <p>Though the folks at shoemaker <b>Allbirds</b> must now be scratching their heads about what was so bad about their \u201csustainable public offering\u201d line kiboshed by the SEC (no one just makes shoes these days), Expensify founder David Barrett piles it on with the big picture/social responsibility stuff and topics that seem only tangentially related to the investment premise here.</p>\n              <p>In a letter to investors (now mandatory, of course, for Silicon Valley types), Barrett argues that the company is no more just a corporate card than<b> Google</b> is just a search engine or <b>Microsoft</b> just an operating system (well, they are, aren\u2019t they?).</p>\n              <p>\u201cBoth established an unassailable hold on one critical feature, and then built a moat around it a lightyear wide through ancillary features and services,\u201d Barrett goes on.</p>\n              <p>\u201cThat deep gravity well of products and services inexorably tugs at every business in the solar system, gradually pulling them into orbit no matter where they started.</p>\n              <p>\u201cWe aim to do the same: to establish a dominant position in business expense management, and then surround it with a wide array of social, consumer, and prosumer functionality that tips everyone's trajectory towards our sun, a little more every day.\u201d</p>\n              <p>Though at times it sounds like Barrett has had a bit too much sun (according to the company, humility is a \u201ccore quality\u201d of the firm), he is not your grandfather\u2019s CEO.</p>\n              <p>Famously Barrett <a href=\"https://community.expensify.com/discussion/7641/david-barretts-email-promoting-joe-biden-violated-our-corporate-policy-on-political-lobbying\">ran afoul of his own company</a> last year when he boldly emailed all its customers telling them a vote for President Trump was \u201ca vote against democracy\u201d.</p>\n              <p>One of the reasons Barrett justified urging Expensify\u2019s clients to vote for Joe Biden is that the company could weather the blowback because it was profitable and taken little outside investment since it was founded. Well, that is something.</p>\n              <p>In any case, <span>JP Morgan</span>, <span>Citigroup</span> and <span>Bank of America</span> (no Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley here) are leading the sale of 9.7m Expensify shares, including 7.1m from selling insiders (Boston\u2019s OpenView Venture Partners is the biggest seller), at $23-$25 for pricing Tuesday, November 9.</p>\n              <p>The IPO values Expensify at a fully diluted market cap of up to $2.5bn.</p>\n              <p>Though it sounds a bit more mundane than the way Barrett might describe it, Expensify offers cloud-based software that enables 660,000-plus paid members to automate their expense management by snapping a photo of receipts to sync with accounting software for automatic tracking and payment. Members can also book travel and use the Expensify business credit card for faster reporting and reconciliation, and can also create and send invoices, as well as split bills and request personal payments.</p>\n              <p>In H1 2021, Expensify reported net income of $14.7m from revenue of $65m, the latter up 60% year-over-year. That said, Covid-19 and associated travel restrictions meant the membership base fell 15% during the worst of the pandemic and remains below the pre-pandemic level of 742,000.</p>\n              <p>Expensify's filing also includes flash numbers for the September quarter revealing an increase in paid members lifted revenue by as much as 73.3% to $37.6m, though the company expects a net loss of $8.1m-$12.1m for that period due to \"one-time special bonus expenses\".</p>\n              <p>In not-so-democratic twist on the super-voting share structure popular among US tech companies, Expensify comes with three classes of stock, the Class A shares sold in the offering, plus \"LT10\" and \"LT50\" stock.</p>\n              <p>Each share of LT10 and LT50 stock is entitled to 10 and 50 votes but cannot be transferred for 10 months and 50 months. This structure concentrates control of the company with a \"voting trust\", whose trustees are Barrett (the company's CEO), CFO Ryan Schaffer, and Jason Mills, the company's chief product officer.</p>\n              <p>Notably, Barrett previously led engineering for Red Swoosh, the peer-to-peer file-sharing company co-founded by former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick (apparently not the most sensitive CEO of all time) and bought by Akamai Technologies in 2007.</p>\n              <p>While living in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, Barrett set out to build a private label electronic food stamp card he could hand out to anyone in need and could be used once a day for up to $10 a day at restaurants that didn't serve alcohol.</p>\n              <p>Barrett said that idea proved too difficult for banks to embrace, and he instead decided to create a corporate card for small businesses that they could hand out to their employees while keeping the rewards.</p>\n              <p>\"The SMB expense management market is like the land that time forgot\u2014a huge, high margin, largely untapped 'silent majority' of the market that is scraping by with antique solutions. And we are the ones that have created a single, powerful, easy-to-use tool with a viral, word-of-mouth model to capture and modernize it at scale. But expense management alone was never the full plan, just the foundation for what's to come.\"</p>\n              <p>Barrett said Expensify had created a \u201cpayments superapp\u201d, but the company's long-term vision was to create the first \u201cfinancial social network\u201d.</p>\n              <p>He hasn\u2019t forgotten about the little people.</p>\n              <p>Last year, the company created a charity wing, Expensify.org, that gets a small donation with every swipe of the Expensify card and aims to \u201ccreate a just and generous world.\u201d</p>\n              <h3>Adventing</h3>\n              <p>Advent International, one of the most seasoned private equity firms and survivor through many cycles, is not done yet after a huge year of monetization activity via US ECM.</p>\n              <p>Having already taken portfolio companies<b> Olaplex</b>, <b>Sovos Brands</b>, <b>First Watch</b> and <b>Definitive Healthcare</b> public in the US this year, Advent is also the major shareholder of NYSE-bound Brazilian software engineering/digital transformation services firm <b>CI&amp;T</b>.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Goldman Sachs</span>, <span>Citigroup</span>, <span>JP Morgan</span> and <span>Morgan Stanley</span> are marketing 19.4m shares at $17-$19 for pricing next Tuesday, November 9 (the same night as Rivian).</p>\n              <p>The offering includes 8.3m secondary shares from Advent International and CI&amp;T\u2019s co-founders. Advent will continue to hold at least 46m shares or 41% voting power.</p>\n              <p>The terms value CI&amp;T at about $2.4bn versus run-rate net revenue of about $245m based on its H1 2021 numbers.</p>\n              <p>This is familiar territory for ECM participants since CI&amp;T competes with the likes of <b>Endava</b>, <b>Globant</b> and <b>EPAM Systems</b>, all of which have crossed the paths of IPO investors in the past.</p>\n              <h3>Lost in translation</h3>\n              <p>In a potentially ominous sign for future China-to-US listings, cross-border biotech <b>LianBio </b>plunged 14.4% on its Nasdaq debut today following last week\u2019s delay in the pricing of its $325m IPO.</p>\n              <p>LianBio, which has offices in both Shanghai and New Jersey (somewhat muddying the waters in terms of describing its domicile, though like most Chinese deals it is incorporated in the Caymans), finally gained effectiveness from the SEC late Friday for the sale of 20.3m shares at $16.00.</p>\n              <p>Unfortunately, this was two days later than planned after the securities watchdog put the deal through the regulatory wringer in what cynics might describe as payback for the <b>Didi Global</b> episode.</p>\n              <p>Last Wednesday, <span>Goldman Sachs</span>,<span> Jefferies</span> and<span> Bank of America </span> went out with pricing of a fully sized offering at $16.00, the midpoint of the $15-$17 marketing range. They were able to hold the book together at that price despite the SEC\u2019s concerns and plenty of space devoted in the risk factors section to the potential for Chinese interference in its operations.</p>\n              <p>In March, LianBio raised $310m on a Series A private round led by biotech VCs Perceptive Advisors and RA Capital and supported by crossover investors such as T. Rowe Price and Wellington Investments.</p>\n              <p>It is believed those crossover investors also participated in the IPO.</p>\n              <p>Indeed, the banks concentrated allocations with existing shareholders to compensate for a lack of incremental support from new investors.</p>\n              <p>LianBio closed today at $13.70, though at least it was on relatively light volume of just 2.4m shares ($14.46 one-day VWAP).</p>\n              <p>LianBio marked the first US IPO with heavy exposure to mainland China since ride hailing giant Didi\u2019s $4.4bn NYSE IPO in late June. Given LianBio\u2019s poor first day of trading, it may take a while before we see another one.</p>\n              <p>Then again, <b>FWD</b>, a Chinese insurer, seems to be moving ahead with its planned US listing, today filing an amendment after first filing with the SEC in September.</p>\n              <p>As outlined in the September IPO filing, <b>Apollo Global</b>-affiliate <b>Athene Life</b> still plans to invest $400m concurrent with the IPO through a private placement, with $50m of that investment locked up for 12 months and the rest for 24 months.</p>\n              <p>FWD and Athene will work together on distribution and reinsurance of insurance.</p>\n              <p>The private placement is in addition to $500m of commitment from anchor investors on the IPO, including $300m from Lik Ka Shing.</p>\n              <h3>#Lovelulus</h3>\n              <p>Online-only fashion brand <b>Lulu\u2019s Fashion House</b> is hoping its growing social media following among Millennial and Gen Z women will translate into high demand for an up to $109m Nasdaq IPO next week.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Goldman Sachs, Bank of America </span>and<span> Jefferies </span>are marketing 5.8m shares at $16-$19, valuing the women\u2019s clothing brand around $710m.</p>\n              <p>Lulu\u2019s is part of a new breed of online-only fashion brands steering its customers to its online retail platform through social media.
