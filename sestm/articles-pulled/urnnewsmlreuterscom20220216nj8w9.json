That\u2019s way worse than the brown envelopes it handed over in places like Vietnam that cost $1 bln in fines. As Ed Cropley explains, the fallout could affect its key U.S. market.<br/>Short Link: <a href=\"https://refini.tv/3LCl9fG\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://refini.tv/3LCl9fG</a><br/><br/>Video Transcript:<br/><br/>This video is sponsored by Refinitiv, a London Stock Exchange business, powering financial markets around the world. <br/><br/>Ericsson's problems with the Feds are going from bad to worse. The Swedish telecom equipment maker has confessed to making payments in Iraq that may have ended up in the hands of Islamic State militants. At the very least, Chief Executive B\u00c3\u00b6rje Ekholm, is looking at a hefty fine. The Department of Justice has only just slapped Ericsson with a $1 billion penalty for passing brown envelopes in countries like Vietnam. The Iraqi payments may be smaller or below Ericsson's \u00e2\u0080\u009cmateriality\u00e2\u0080\u009d threshold, but that's more than offset by the egregious nature of Islamic State. And keeping stunned about the payments which Ericsson uncovered in 2019 will only have made matters worse in the eyes of Uncle Sam. The size of a fine is anybody's guess. But the $4 billion hit to Ericsson's market value on Wednesday provides a clue. It also points to potential hit to Ericsson's 5G mobile equipment business. The company has been doing well of late, thanks to a US squeeze on Chinese rival Huawei. Its North American sales jumped 17% in the last quarter of 2021. But it's now facing stiffer 5G competition from companies like Samsung and Amazon, and the flip side of Huawei coin means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting squeezed out of China by Beijing. Getting squeezed from the world's two biggest markets will be painful.<br/></span></div></div></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
