ECM award categories cover IPOs, follow-ons, CBs and SPACs completed throughout the year in the US and LatAm.</span>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <b>Rivian Automotive</b>\u2019s stunning debut today (see next item for more) highlights how much value ECM can create, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that most offerings right now are not \u201cmust-own\u201d.</p>\n              <p>There remains a huge amount of tension between bankers\u2019 desire to push out as many deals as possible before the end of the year and the quality of demand and buyside concern about how much upside is left in this market.</p>\n              <p>Some fear the banks will keep pushing until the market finally breaks down altogether. It would not be the first time that happened.</p>\n              <p>This sense of an unsustainable deal scramble is reinforced by the fact that most of this week\u2019s heavy deal flow has been compressed into the first three days of the week because of tomorrow\u2019s Veterans Day federal holiday (the SEC is closed).</p>\n              <p>Tonight alone brings at least 13 deals for $2.4bn of proceeds, including five IPOs, seven follow-ons and one CB (plus whatever SPACs price). Including these, the first three days of this week will have seen 25-30 deals priced (and 35 including SPACs), though apart from Rivian and <b>Hertz Global</b> (which fell again in its second Nasdaq session today), most are on the smaller side of things.</p>\n              <p>Today\u2019s IPOs delivered good performance, not just Rivian and <b>Expensify</b> (more below) but even the 40% downsized NYSE offering from Brazilian software engineering firm <b>CI&amp;T</b>. Its shares popped more than 50% intraday before closing their debut session up 20.8%.</p>\n              <p>Notwithstanding that, companies returning with follow-ons are facing the prospect of steep discounts to satisfy hedge fund-heavy books, while some of the stocks that shed the most value in today\u2019s broader market downdraft were 2021 IPOs highly vulnerable to late-year profit-taking.</p>\n              <p>Falling more than 15% today were <b>Poshmark</b>, <b>Monday.com</b> and<b> Agrify, </b>as well as highly fancied names such as<b> Toast, Affirm and Global-E Online </b>(that said, Affirm was rebounding big-time after-hours after the release post-close of its Q3 numbers).</p>\n              <p>\u201cI think many bankers saw the move in the market last week and decided this was a great time to bring deals, so we are seeing a lot of them this week and probably next week too,\u201d one senior ECM banker said.</p>\n              <p>The action is about to grind to a halt, at least until next week.</p>\n              <p>Among the few transactions launched post-close was a $350m CB for additive manufacturing firm <b>3D</b><b>Systems</b> (an unregistered/144A deal, therefore not requiring SEC vetting).</p>\n              <p>In a big week for the firm,<span> Morgan Stanley</span> also slipped in a circa-$575m block sell-down (a 13% stake) in organic food maker Hain Celestial, representing nearly all of sponsor Engaged Capital\u2019s remaining stake. Hain Celestial shares are up 20% this year and have tripled since late 2018.</p>\n              <p>Looking ahead to next week, six IPOs are scheduled (the biggest being the $500m-plus IPO of <b>Kindercare</b>) but the deal mix could turn more secondary-heavy as IPO launches dry up to avoid a clash with Thanksgiving in the following week.</p>\n              <h3>Automatic</h3>\n              <p>With a certain air of inevitability, shares of <b>Rivian Automotive</b> debuted in the triple digits today as many investors saw little choice but to chase a slice of a company that may or may not be the next <b>Tesla</b> but only has to deliver some of the latter\u2019s EV success to turn into a great investment over time.</p>\n              <p>After upsizing the offering by 13% to 153m shares and pricing at $78.00 or $4.00 above the top of the $72\u2013$74 range for $11.9bn of proceeds, Rivian opened at $106.75 for a 36.9% gain.</p>\n              <p>It struggled to hold those gains in a tough tech tape, closing its first session at $100.73, up 29% for the day.</p>\n              <p>It was still a big win for the<span> Morgan Stanley</span>/<span>Goldman Sachs</span>/<span>JP Morgan</span>-led syndicate, not least because the direct order entry/hybrid auction format will likely mean fees from the deal will favor the top of the syndicate.</p>\n              <p>\u201cWe are super-pleased that this went so well, particularly for this time of the year,\u201d one syndicate member said. \u201cThese large $5bn\u2013$10bn deals are incredibly challenging to get to trade well in any situation.</p>\n              <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t push price to the maximum so that there was nothing left for the market, which is important, especially for a company that will need to raise more capital to fund their business plan.\u201d</p>\n              <p>At the opening mark, the 12-year-old maker of EV pickup trucks, SUVs and delivery vans secured a $90bn-plus market cap from what is the biggest IPO in the US and globally this year, as well as the biggest US deal since Alibaba\u2019s 2014 NYSE debut. On Refinitiv data, Rivian also ranks as the 15<sup>th</sup> biggest IPO of all time.</p>\n              <p>That\u2019s an amazing milestone (and a sign of the times) for a company that is only just starting to deliver its first vehicles and collect revenue, and has the job in front of it to deliver on 54,000 pre-orders over the next few years as well as build 100,000 vans for no-doubt demanding customer <b>Amazon</b> (and Rivian is not exactly a household name like most of the other biggest IPOs of all-time).</p>\n              <p>Some are forecasting the company will be producing one million vehicles by the end of the decade (a suspiciously round number), requiring it to build more plants beyond the retooled former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois from which it is producing cars now.</p>\n              <p>The sheer size of the Rivian offering also highlights the massive capex needs the company will have over time, in contrast to big IPOs like <b>Facebook</b> or <b>Twitter</b> that were just about hoarding cash for strategic reasons or funding the tax bills of employees.</p>\n              <p>Central to the success of the deal was the massive $5bn cornerstone investment outlined on the cover of the filing, including some of the biggest names on the Street/in the Valley as a measure of their confidence in founder RJ Scaringe.</p>\n              <p>As for the rest of the book, bankers said there was broad-based support, including from tech-dedicated hedge funds.</p>\n              <p>\u201cInstitutions went into game-theory mode: if the price steps, we need to be there,\u201d another banker said.</p>\n              <p>Still, Scaringe indicated he had hand-selected allocations, suggesting this was a dirty auction and not just a matter who was prepared to pay the highest price.</p>\n              <p>Of course, some credit for the IPO\u2019s success has to go Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk and the trail he has blazed (turns out he has been selling stock in recent days), though Scaringe (and key backer and Musk\u2019s space rival Jeff Bezos) will be hoping for a less eventful journey as a public company.</p>\n              <p>Though deals of this magnitude are rare, bankers do think there could be more of them over the next year or two as more seasoned unicorns come to market.</p>\n              <h3>Expensive?</h3>\n              <p>Subscription-based expense management software firm <b>Expensify</b> added to the brighter tone in the IPO market (in an otherwise tough day for tech stocks) by surging more than 50% in its debut Nasdaq session today.</p>\n              <p>Like Rivian and despite no sign of Morgan Stanley\u2019s or Goldman Sachs\u2019 fingerprints on the deal, Expensify employed the hybrid auction/direct order entry format to set the price. Still, the impact that had on the outcome was debatable since it didn\u2019t exactly dampen aftermarket performance.</p>\n              <p>Using their own technology, <span>JP Morgan</span>, <span>Citigroup</span> and <span>Bank of America</span> last night priced 9.7m Expensify shares, including 7.1m from selling shareholders, at $27, the top of the $25\u2013$27 range. In response to strong early demand, the syndicate increased the range from $23\u2013$25 earlier this year.</p>\n              <p>The stock opened at $39.75 and traded up to close at $41.06 for a 52.1% gain.</p>\n              <p>The final IPO terms valued Expensify at about $2.6bn rising to about $4bn at today\u2019s close or about 35x EV/sales on a trailing basis.</p>\n              <p>Founded in 2008 by David Barrett (<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/expensify-ceo-david-barrett-emails-customers-vote-biden/\">a man who wears his politics on his sleeve</a>), Expensify offers cloud-based software that enables its 660,000-plus paid members to automate their expense management by snapping a photo of receipts to sync with accounting software for automatic tracking and payment.</p>\n              <p>Members can also book travel and use the Expensify business credit card for faster reporting and reconciliation. They can also create and send invoices and split bills and request personal payments.</p>\n              <h3>Blistering pace</h3>\n              <p>Despite stock market indexes at record levels, or because of this, long-only investors are skittish heading into year-end at the same time private equity and venture sponsors are looking to aggressively crystallize gains.</p>\n              <p>The stampede to sell has backers of six companies that have gone public over the past year seeking this evening to price $1.1bn worth of follow-on stock sales.</p>\n              <p>\u201cEveryone under the sun is coming to market,\u201d said one ECM banker. \u201c(But) investment committees at many mutual fund complexes are nervous about the market.</p>\n              <p>\u201cA lot of these deals are not viewed as must-own. There aren\u2019t catalysts that are going to lift these stock before year-end.</p>\n              <p>\u201cThat is forcing us to rely more upon hedge funds to get these deals, and that comes at price.\u201d</p>\n              <p>The catalyst for some is Q3 earnings, but those positives are baked into the stock.</p>\n              <p>\n                <b>First Advantage</b>, the screening software provider that went public in June (at $15.00), fell 10.6% to $20.56 in the past two sessions while publicly marketing the secondary sale of 15m shares. This was despite strong quarterly earnings leading up to the deal\u2019s launch.</p>\n              <p>The offering, jointly led by <span>Barclays</span> and <span>Bank of America</span>, saw Silver Lake reduce its stake to 60.7% from 72.4%, but leaving a still sizable overhang.</p>\n              <p>The deal comes inside lock-up, but more lenient exemptions have been granted and First Advantage is exceeded expectations.</p>\n              <p>First Advantage shares spiked 14.6% when it reported Q2 earnings in August, and rose another 9.3% on Q3 earnings reported pre-open Monday, only to recalibrate when word of the stock sale hit late Monday.</p>\n              <p>First Advantage\u2019s Q3 adjusted Ebitda and revenue of $63.9m and $192.9m easily exceeded the $50.3m and $171.6m consensus. This is a high cashflow story that is benefiting from increased hiring activity and the need to run background checks.</p>\n              <p>Like many industry verticals that have been introduced to public markets this year, ID/screening software is new, emerging investable opportunity, and one that (not surprisingly) does not lack options beyond First Advantage.</p>\n              <p>\u201cWe got a nice lift heading into the launch,\u201d said the banker. \u201cFirst Advantage is perceived by many to be the market leader, but there\u2019s still a lot of investors not following this sector.\u201d</p>\n              <p>Following in the footsteps of First Advantage, Goldman Sachs-backed background check provider <b>Sterling Check</b> (+11.9%) went public in September and the General Atlantic-backed <b>HireRight</b> (-3.7%) provided yet another option when it went public in October.</p>\n              <p>With so many options, perhaps now is not the time to ask investors to write checks on new investments.</p>\n              <p>The higher costs of sponsor exits is evident. Of the six secondary sell-downs due to price this evening, four fell double-digit percentages over the marketing period, and a fifth was down 9.6%.</p>\n              <h3>Need to Know</h3>\n              <p>Only <b>KnowBe4</b>, a private equity-backed cybersecurity specialist that went public in April, benefited from marketing, and then only eking out a 1.1% gain to close today\u2019s session at $20.56.</p>\n              <p>The KnowBe4 secondary sale of 7m shares, a thin 4.1% stake, saw Elephant Partners, KKR and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs reduce their stakes to 22.3%, 15.7% and 6.9%.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Morgan Stanley</span>, <span>Goldman Sachs</span>, <span>Bank of America</span> and <span>KKR</span> were joint books, a little bit of home cooking though notably this is a first-time follow-on that coincides with the November 9 expiry of the IPO lock-up.</p>\n              <h3>Diversification not needed</h3>\n              <p>\n                <b>Diversey</b>, a manufacturer of hygienic products for hospitals and the hospitality industry, seemed precariously close to \u201cbreaking the IPO bank\u201d as its shares fell 11.1% to $15.12 over the two days 15m shares were being marketed on behalf of Bain Capital.</p>\n              <p>Bain, which purchased the business in 2017 took it public in March, reduced its stake to 74.5% from 78.5%.</p>\n              <p>The $692.3m IPO priced at $15.00 was all-primary and used to repay debt, so this is the first chance Bain has had to sell stock.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Citigroup</span> and <span>Morgan Stanley</span>, which were joint books on the IPO and are jointly running tonight\u2019s follow-on, may be put in the uncomfortable position of defending the IPO a second time.</p>\n              <p>\n                <b>Apria</b>, the Blackstone-backed in-home healthcare provider, saw similarly tepid investor receptivity for its all-secondary of 4.5m shares, already the second sell-down since its IPO in February.</p>\n              <p>Apria fell 9.6% over the two-day marketing period to $32.54, comfortably above both the $27.00 price on a similarly sized sale by Blackstone in June and the $20.00 IPO price.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Citigroup</span> and <span>Goldman Sachs</span> were joint books, a notable narrowing of the underwriting syndicate from the earlier deals.</p>\n              <p>\n                <b>European Wax Centers</b>, the General Atlantic-backed bikini-wax store operator, shaved off 13.2% to $26.83 while marketing its first-time follow-on, and medical device-marker <b>908 Devices</b>\u2019 sellers were evaluating options after a 16.6% decline while marketing 2.8m secondary shares.</p>\n              <p>The average file-to-last sale sell-off on tonight\u2019s secondary sales was 10%.</p>\n              <h3>Money-hungry Mirati</h3>\n              <p>In a two-horse race to develop a promising cancer drug, <b>Mirati Therapeutics</b> is viewed as a distant second, though the race is not over and the potential of its cancer drug has yet to be determined.</p>\n              <p>Mirati returned to ECM this evening for $500m of fresh capital to help fund Phase III trials on its cancer drug, as well other drugs that at earlier stages of development.</p>\n              <p>Shares of Mirati plunged 11.4% to $148.77 while the fixed-size offering was marketed by <span>Goldman Sachs</span>, <span>SVB Leerink</span> and <span>Cowen </span>for one day today. Raising equity is almost an annual ritual for Mirati, which raised $875m from a follow-on stock sale in October last year at $202.00.</p>\n              <p>Tonight\u2019s raise adds to a $1.1bn cash pile at September 30.</p>\n              <p>The stock\u2019s underperformance is partly due to the approval of Amgen\u2019s cancer drug in May that blocks proteins that contribute to cancer.</p>\n              <p>Mirati plans to submit its application for a competing drug with the FDA by the end of the year, specifically to treat non-small cell lung cancer. It is conducting Phase III trials on that same drug in combination with Eli Lilly\u2019s Erbitux for colorectal cancer.</p>\n              <p>The company is also in the midst of a management restructuring.</p>\n              <p>In September, Mirati tapped David Meek as CEO to lead the commercial launch of its cancer drug, replacing Mirati founder Charles Baum who is staying on as president and head of R&amp;D.</p>\n              <p>Mirati\u2019s COO and chief science officer both stepped down from their posts earlier this month, with Meek and Baum expanding filling their roles.</p>\n              <p>Mirati is still looking for a new CFO.</p>\n              <p>The abrupt management changes may have spooked some investors. The long term opportunity for Mirati\u2019s lead drug is another a point of concern.</p>\n              <p>Investors are still a few years away from a payoff. The management upheaval comes as analysts have Mirati hemorrhaging some $1.3bn of adjusted Ebitda over the next two years with revenue only gradually ramping to $250m in 2023, according to Refinitiv data.</p>\n              <h3>Getting the timing right</h3>\n              <p>\n                <b>SiTime</b>, a maker of silicon-based timing products used in electronic devices, took advantage of the strength of the chip stocks to price a $450m follow-on stock sale late night.</p>\n              <p>After a day of marketing, a syndicate led by <span>Barclays</span>, <span>Credit Suisse</span> and <span>Stifel</span> priced the sale of 2m shares, including 1m primary and 1m from Japanese-based major shareholder <b>MegaChips</b>, at $225.00.</p>\n              <p>The offering, representing nearly 10% of the company, came at a hefty 22.8% file-to-offer discount, though SiTime shares had more than doubled in the past year leading into the deal and are up massively since the company went public at just $13.00 in November 2019.</p>\n              <p>In today's aftermarket, the shares closed at $228.36 or slightly above the offering price.</p>\n              <p>\"There was a nice mix of new and existing investors,\" one banker close to the deal said, noting SiTime was a beneficiary of the strong chip market but not directly impacted by chip shortages.</p>\n              <p>MegaChips is left with a 24.7% stake and can sell more in 60 days.</p>\n              <h3>Beauty treatment</h3>\n              <p>Private equity firm <b>KKR &amp; Co</b> disposed of its remaining 2.4% stake in <b>Coty</b> via a <span>Morgan Stanley</span>-led $210m unregistered block trade last night, a deal the beauty products firm said would \u201cfurther simplify\u201d its capital structure and conserve cash.</p>\n              <p>Morgan Stanley reoffered 20m Coty shares at $10.50, inside the $10.35\u2013$10.81 range and a 2.9% discount to last sale.</p>\n              <p>Coty, probably best known for its $600m purchase of a controlling stake in Kylie Jenner\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics in late 2019, struggled to hold its ground in today\u2019s aftermarket, closing at $10.49.</p>\n              <p>Following three separate sales over the past three months and coming in the wake of Monday\u2019s 15% surge in Coty\u2019s share price after upbeat earnings, KKR converted its remaining holdings of convertible preferred shares into common stock before offloading them via the block.</p>\n              <p>The latest sale leaves Coty with $146m of convertible preferred shares outstanding, or the equivalent of 23m shares. These are held by Coty chairman Peter Harf, also a partner of Coty\u2019s controlling shareholder, Dutch/German privately held investment firm JAB.</p>\n              <p>The price of the latest block was above the $8.39 mark at which KKR offloaded 50m Coty shares in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1024305/000114036121030942/brhc10028856_sc13da.htm\">early September</a>, also via a Morgan Stanley block trade (the reoffer price was $8.53 according to our records).</p>\n              <p>KKR took a $1bn stake in Coty last year as part of a deal that also saw the private equity firm buy 60% of the Wella haircare business.</p>\n              <p>More recently, Coty sold additional smaller stakes in the Wella haircare brand to KKR in exchange for some of KKR's remaining convertible preferreds (part of that deal was announced <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005398/en/Coty-Builds-on-Previous-Transaction-and-Agrees-to-Sell-Additional-Partial-Stake-in-Wella-to-KKR-in-Exchange-for-Approximately-56-of-the-Preferred-Coty-Shares-Owned-by-KKR\">earlier this week</a>).</p>\n              <p>JAB, which owns 56.8% of Coty at last count (prior to the latest deal), has had a busy week already, yesterday striking a deal with big-name restaurateur Danny Meyer to help take <b>Panera Bread</b> public in the coming months.</p>\n              <p>Panera said in a <a href=\"https://www.jabholco.com/documents/6/PaneraBrands_ITF-FINAL.pdf\">press release yesterday</a> it intended to file a draft registration statement for the IPO, suggesting it is still several months away.</p>\n              <h3>Fashion victim</h3>\n              <p>Just in time for the holiday shopping season, <b>Lulu\u2019s Fashion House</b> is close to securing roughly $90m of new funding this evening from its IPO, though that is less than hoped.</p>\n              <p>\n                <span>Goldman Sachs</span>, <span>Bank of America</span> and <span>Jefferies </span>stitched together a book of demand by anchoring the sale of 5.75m new shares at $16.00, the bottom of a $16\u2013$18, they communicated ahead of the market open today.</p>\n              <p>At $16.00, the IPO values Lulu\u2019s around $600m on a fully diluted basis.</p>\n              <p>The online fashion retailer follows some tepid debuts by <b>aka Brands</b> (+7.7%) and<b> Rent-the-Runway</b> (18.6%).</p>\n              <p>Still, Lulu\u2019s high growth and online-only platform made for positive comparisons to <b>Revolve</b>, whose shares have soared 157% this year.</p>\n              <p>Revolve shares dipped 4.65% today to $80.10.</p>\n              <p>Lulu\u2019s is profitable.
