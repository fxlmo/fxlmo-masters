Already, bulldozers have begun destroying the land \u2013 in our view this is unlawful,\" said Jenkins.</p><p>Jenkins said the Observatory Civic Association and Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Traditional Indigenous Council had lodged a court interdict against the development, with the matter to be heard in court on November 24 to 25.</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos has announced at COP26 that he will commit $2 billion (R29bn) toward climate change mitigation in Africa. Yet, this development is the antithesis of what he is pledging, since it is a green lung of the city, as well as a delicate ecosystem and site of endangered flora and fauna,\" said Jenkins.</p><p>Observatory Civic Association chairperson Professor Leslie London said: \"The problem is our leaders say nice things in grand public forums, but when it applies to local development, that commitment is discounted or goes out the window.</p><p>\"This particular development never had a climate change assessment. It's just completely antithetical to what we're being asked to do on a global scale.\"</p><p>shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za</p><p><a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/capeargus\"><span>Cape Argus</span> </a> </p><p>Cape Argus \u00a9 1999 - 2021 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.
