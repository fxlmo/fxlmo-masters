The combination proactively and continuously identifies cyber exposures as new services are deployed, illuminating potential weaknesses that represent attack paths that could be used to compromise critical assets that originate from threats in or outside of the cloud. </p>\n<p>Hybrid cloud computing architecture can present a number of cybersecurity challenges. Attackers can exploit security gaps such as misconfigurations, overly permissive identities, vulnerabilities, and human errors to obtain an initial foothold in the network and move laterally between on-premises and cloud applications.</p>\n<p>Through an attack-centric approach, XM Cyber helps customers pinpoint areas of potential risk, combining critical software vulnerabilities identified by Amazon Inspector with potential attack paths that highlight exposed resources to exploitable security risk. The attack path context provided by XM Cyber helps customers understand what changes are needed to quickly eliminate the risk of resource compromise and lateral movement to other assets. XM Cyber and Amazon Inspector both support <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3373483-1&amp;h=1312468505&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fsecurity-hub%2F&amp;a=AWS+Security+Hub\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Security Hub</a>, which helps customers aggregate security alerts, identify misconfigured resources, and operationalize remediation actions.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>\"The combination of Amazon Inspector and XM Cyber is a powerful security solution for our customers,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Fuller</span><b><u>,</u></b> Director, Product Management, AWS Security Services at AWS. \"With the new Amazon Inspector, we've dramatically simplified continuous and automated vulnerability assessment for customers across their entire organization, whether they have one AWS account or five thousand.
