The pair clawed back losses into\nEuropean hours, before receiving a boost from cross-flows after ECB monetary\npolicy decision. The greenback went offered against the euro as ECB Pres\nLagarde refused to rule out a rate hike this year. NZD/USD held the bulk of\npost-ECB gains into the close, making Thursday a bullish outside day.</pre>\n<pre>* U.S. equity market dynamics continue to affect G10 price action, with strong\n  earnings reports from Amazon and Snapchat lending helping the tech space\n  recover. Risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies outperform at the margin as we\n  type.\n* NZD/USD has added 8 pips thus far and last operates at $0.6669. A break above\n  the $0.6702/03 area, which limited losses in Dec, would shift bullish focus\n  to Jan 19 high of $0.6812. Bears see Jan 28 low of $0.6530 as their initial\n  target.\n* Note that PM Ardern is in Auckland, where she will speak about the Omicron\n  outbreak. On the data front, focus now turns to New Zealand's inflation\n  expectations (Wednesday) and BusinessNZ Manufacturing PMI (Friday).</pre>\n</div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 Thomson Reuters Limited.</p></div>"}
