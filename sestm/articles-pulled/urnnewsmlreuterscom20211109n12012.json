With this, she highlights that even mature industries that have lagged the broader tech sector have done well, saying that PCs, for example, experienced their highest U.S. growth rate in two decades. </p><p>However, she also says that while the sector has appreciated significantly as a whole, its leadership over the past five years has narrowed considerably. In fact, the vast majority of growth over the time period came from the five largest names in the S&amp;P 500, which now make up approximately 25% of index.</p><p>Their combined market capitalization exploded nearly 500% since the end of 2016, from $2.0 trillion to $9.9 trillion, with more than half of that increase coming since March 2020 alone.</p><p>Although, Nuveen is a structural bull on the technology sector and believes that mega-cap tech companies will remain dominant in their respective arenas over the long term, Malik thinks these areas now face significant headwinds.</p><p>Rising interest rates, higher inflation and slowing growth have already taken a toll on earnings, and she thinks that if these headwinds persist, the remarkable pace of outperformance by mega-cap names will likely prove unsustainable over the near term. </p><p>\"As a result, we have become more selective toward technology stocks and expect a broadening of leadership in the sector to provide investors with attractive opportunities beyond the best-known names.\"</p><p><br/></p><p>(Terence Gabriel)</p><p>*****</p><p>    </p><p><span class=\"tr-strong\">STOXX STUMBLES, MISSES 9TH STRAIGHT SESSION OF GAINS (</span>1157 EDT/1657 GMT)</p><p>Today's session started with some encouraging milestones, notably French and German blue chip indexes reaching new record highs in late morning trading. </p><p>Sentiment, however, gradually fizzled in afternoon trading when Wall Street opened and went into negative territory as the rally lost a few puffs of steam.  </p><p>Granted, there is absolutely nothing spectacular with European equities losing a modest 0.2% today, but it marks the end of eight-straight sessions of gains. </p><p>That said, the pan-European STOXX closed at 482.71, about 0.5% away from its all-time high of 485.13 reached on November 5. </p><p>While the momentum provided by an upbeat Q3 earnings season seems to be fading away, there also seems to be no imminent threat to the rally with central banks in no apparent rush to hike rates.</p><p>     </p><p><div class=\"tr-resource-ref\" id=\"g6315cfb5-c11a-4eb1-92b3-735f28eb98d3\"><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjkkabpe/Pasted%20image%201636476515759.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5nZngudGhvbXNvbnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2dmeC9ta3QvYnlwcmpra2FicGUvUGFzdGVkJTIwaW1hZ2UlMjAxNjM2NDc2NTE1NzU5LnBuZw==&amp;storyId=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20211109:nL1N2S01YT:2&amp;key=87b6a19a025028643865bdf928554d8e25e1a2188f4b4fce30f511d51f204d737ac26e69f69763578ae413819ae5bed6bce675c92ba5fd63cd659e8aa528dd51\"/></div></div></div></p><p><br/></p><p>(Julien Ponthus) </p><p>*****</p><p><br/></p><p>THE OTHER GLOBAL WARMING: PPI, BUSINESS SENTIMENT (1100 EDT/1600 GMT)</p><p>Inflation continues to gather heat in the United States, and words like 'persistent' and 'prolonged' are starting to drown the Fed's 'transitory' chant.   </p><p>And data released on Tuesday confirmed that stubbornly tight supply of goods and labor is causing the mercury continues to rise at U.S. businesses. </p><p>Producer prices (PPI) <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=USPPFD=ECI\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"USPPFD=ECI\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">USPPFD=ECI</a>, prices U.S. goods makers receive for their merchandise at the loading dock, rose as expected last month to 0.6% an uptick from September's 0.5% increase. <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2S0145\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2S0145\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span></p><p>A quick stroll of the data line-by-line reveals that spiking prices for energy goods and services and raw materials provided the heftiest thrust, offsetting declines in vehicles. </p><p>\"Inflation readings continue to reflect pandemic-related effects including demand and supply imbalances.
