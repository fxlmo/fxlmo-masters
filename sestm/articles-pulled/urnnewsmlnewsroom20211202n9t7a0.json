(TSXV: HAM) (\"Highwood\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the filing of NI 43-101 Technical Report Lithium Resource Estimate for its Drumheller Property.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Highlights</span>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>The Drumheller Property land base of 363,522 hectares (895,811 acres) represents 23.5% of Highwood's total <span>Alberta</span> and <span>British Columbia</span> land position.</li>\n<li>The initial Inferred Lithium-Brine Resource at <span>Drumheller</span> has been calculated within 3 separate resource domains, the combined total of which is estimated to contain 18.14 million metric tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>NI 43-101 Technical Report</span>\n</p>\n<p>Highwood commissioned APEX Geoscience Ltd. to prepare a National Instrument 43-101 Report effectively dated <span>February 21, 2022</span> (the \"Technical Report\") to detail the inferred resource assessment for the Company's Drumheller Property. The Drumheller Property comprises approximately 23.5% of Highwood's total <span>Alberta</span> and <span>British Columbia</span> land position. The Technical Report for the Project is available on SEDAR ( <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3456069-1&amp;h=3292856812&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com%2F&amp;a=www.sedar.com\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.sedar.com</a> ) and on the Company's website.</p>\n<p>The Drumheller Resource Project area (363,522 hectares) has over 3,675 historical oil and gas wells that were drilled by petro-companies into the Devonian aged carbonate reef strata from the youngest (Nisku Formation) to the oldest (Beaverhill Lake Group). Current hydrocarbon production occurs within two oil pools located near the townsite of <span>Drumheller</span> .</p>\n<p>Geological information culled from the oil and gas wells included formation picks, wireline logs, core plug measurements and drill stem tests. Based on the assessment of these data, a 3-D geological model was created with emphasis on 3 distinct resource domains:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leduc Aquifer Domain: The Leduc Formation aquifer, which underlies most of the Property \u2013 apart from the area northwest of the Killam Barrier Reef where the <span>Leduc</span> abruptly transitions to Duvernay Formation shale.</li>\n<li>Nisku Killam Barrier Reef Aquifer Domain: A wireframed zone of the Nisku Formation aquifer within the northeast-trending, linear Killam Barrier Reef and an area that extends 10 km east of the reef edge. This domain is uniquely modelled as a zone in which the <span>Nisku</span> and <span>Leduc</span> formation aquifers are in hydro-communication with one another.</li>\n<li>Nisku Platform/Basin Aquifer Domain: The area of remaining Nisku Formation aquifer volume that occurs outside of the Nisku Killam Barrier Reef Aquifer Domain. The domain includes Nisku Formation within the East Platform Shelf (east and southeast Property) and East Shale Basin (uppermost northwest corner of the Property). It is assumed that the <span>Nisku</span> in this domain is not in hydro-communication with the <span>Leduc</span> aquifer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<p>Critical steps in the determination of Highwood's <span>Drumheller</span> lithium-brine resource estimation include:</p>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Leduc Aquifer Domain porosity: 9.9%.</li>\n<li>Nisku Killam Barrier Reef Domain Aquifer Domain porosity: 6.1%.</li>\n<li>Nisku Platform/Basin Aquifer Domain porosity: 6.8%.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Definition of the geology and geometry of the subsurface <span>Leduc</span> and <span>Nisku</span> formations underlying the Drumheller Property based on 1,975 wells and 1,181 surface top horizon formation picks.

Numerous small private landholdings within the Drumheller Property outline were removed from the estimation process.</li>\n<li>Hydrogeological characterization and a historical compilation and assessment of average porosity within the 3 resource domains were based on 1,761 effective porosity and permeability measurements, 126,590 calculated total porosity records and 811 drill stem tests:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Leduc Aquifer Domain porosity: 48.3 mg/L lithium.</li>\n<li>Nisku Killam Barrier Reef Domain Aquifer Domain porosity: 41.4 mg/L lithium.</li>\n<li>Nisku Platform/Basin Aquifer Domain porosity: 25.2 mg/L lithium.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Determination of the lithium-in-brine concentration within the 3 resource domains were based on 27 brine analytical results:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Leduc Aquifer Domain porosity: 98%.</li>\n<li>Nisku Killam Barrier Reef Domain Aquifer Domain porosity: 98%.</li>\n<li>Nisku Platform/Basin Aquifer Domain porosity: 98%.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Definition of the pore space volume of brine within the 3 resource domains were based on 122 petro-fluid production records over the last 3-years of production:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n<li>Estimate of the <span>in-situ</span> lithium resources of the 3-resource domain aquifers underlying the Drumheller Property using the relation: <span>Lithium Resource = Total Volume of the Brine-Bearing Aquifer X Average Effective Porosity X Percentage of Brine in Pore Space x Average Concentration of Lithium in the Brine.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Drumheller Leduc Formation lithium-brine resource estimate is classified as an 'Inferred Mineral Resource' in accordance with guidelines established by the CIM \"Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines\" dated <span>November 29</span>\n<span>th</span> , 2019, and the CIM \"Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" amended and adopted <span>May 10</span>\n<span>th</span> , 2014.</p>\n<p>Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
