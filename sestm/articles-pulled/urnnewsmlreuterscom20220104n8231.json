The opinions expressed are his own.</p><p class=\"tr-by\">By Richard Beales</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\"><span class=\"tr-dateline\">NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters Breakingviews)</span><span class=\"tr-dl-sep\"> - </span>Microsoft <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=MSFT.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"MSFT.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MSFT.O</a> is the oldest of the current crop of technology Goliaths. Yet despite roots in the bell-bottom days of 1975, the $2.5 trillion software maker has been a recent Big Tech standout in terms of share-price performance. Boss Satya Nadella is poised to deliver again. That could make him the most successful second-generation chief executive ever, measured by value created.</p><p>Nadella took over in 2014 from Steve Ballmer, an early employee of founder Bill Gates. Microsoft\u2019s market worth has grown by $2.2 trillion, from little more than $300 billion then. So far, Tim Cook at Apple <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AAPL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AAPL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AAPL.O</a> has presided over a slightly larger increase in market value since officially taking over from Steve Jobs in 2011. But Nadella, who started from a smaller base and has had less time, is breathing down Cook\u2019s neck. Sundar Pichai, first at Google and then at parent Alphabet <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=GOOGL.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"GOOGL.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">GOOGL.O</a>, is far behind. </p><p>And Microsoft is on a roll. The so-called FAANG stocks \u2013 Meta Platforms <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=FB.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"FB.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">FB.O</a> (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>, Netflix <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=NFLX.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"NFLX.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">NFLX.O</a> and Alphabet \u2013 are a favorite yardstick for investors. Stacked against them, the total return on Microsoft stock over the year to Dec. 8 is second only to Alphabet, and over three and five years it\u2019s second only to Apple. </p><p>Gates\u2019 middle-aged company still has plenty of energy left, too <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL1N2RM2F8\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL1N2RM2F8\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>. In a November report, analysts at Deutsche Bank pointed to the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d known as Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing business. Amazon Web Services used to dominate the public cloud. It had a 65% market share in 2017, versus 20% for Azure and just 15% for Google\u2019s offering. By 2020, Microsoft had raised its share to 30%, almost entirely at Amazon\u2019s expense, according to Deutsche.</p><p>Microsoft has traditional strengths with business customers and the resources to come from behind. That happened with the company\u2019s Teams product after Slack Technologies developed the market for workplace-chat software - and it could happen again with the idea of the so-called metaverse <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2SU3CD\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2SU3CD\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>, beloved of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>Between cloud computing, productivity, collaboration and even gaming, Microsoft\u2019s activities mesh with powerful, global digital trends. Deutsche\u2019s number-crunchers picked a target stock price that\u2019s more than 15% above the company\u2019s early December trading price. That could add another $400 billion or so to Nadella\u2019s value-creation tally, and take him past Cook.</p><p><div class=\"tr-resource-ref\" id=\"d82c9a77-57d1-4cbc-818f-e492f79ba541\"><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/BRV-BRV/lbvgnljjbpq/chart.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9ncmFwaGljcy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9CUlYtQlJWL2xidmdubGpqYnBxL2NoYXJ0LnBuZw==&amp;storyId=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20220104:nL8N2SY3ZS:1&amp;key=971568e032cc3185b4af4184a5af4c7c43f7289c7190543874e5a6d59672222c7059ec1dbe3e8b3e145c0dd90979c1e9c189a0245ea2d1a8c6d4fa1ea8258ea7\"/></div></div></div></p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardbeales1\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@richardbeales1</a> on Twitter</p><p><br/></p><div style=\"display:none;\" class=\"tr-sandwichbox\"></div><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Editing by Rob Cox, Oliver Taslic and Amanda Gomez)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">((For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=BEALES/\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"BEALES/\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">BEALES/</a> <br/> SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS <a href=\"https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://bit.ly/BVsubscribe</a> | <a href=\"mailto:richard.beales@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">richard.beales@thomsonreuters.com</a> ; Reuters Messaging: <a class=\"tr-link tr-link-rm\" href=\"rm://richard.beales.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\">richard.beales.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net</a> ))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.
