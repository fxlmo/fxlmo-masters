Using artificial intelligence (AI) modeling and any camera, 3DAT can extract information about the form and motion of athletes that goes undetected by the naked eye, making biomechanics more accessible than ever. Talent scouting app AiSCOUT utilizes 3DAT to provide opportunities to amateur soccer players across the globe to be scouted using only the player\u2019s mobile phone. This is just the beginning. Learn how to use Intel\u2019s 3DAT Cloud SDK and API to deploy new applications.\n<br/><b>Intel Speaker:</b> Jonathan Lee, director of Sports Performance Technology\n</p><p>\n<b>Title: Engineering for Social Impact Through the Power of HPC (Session: EUC305-S</b>)\n</p><p>\nHigh performance computing (HPC) in the cloud is redefining what is possible and driving positive social impact around the world. Most recently, one of the largest HPC runs in the cloud, conducted on AWS architecture and powered by Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors, has enabled open-source platform VirtualFlow to conduct drug discovery at the scale of billions of molecules. This platform plans to host the world\u2019s largest virtual screening of drug molecules needed to accelerate cancer research.\n<br/><b>Intel Speaker: </b>Rebecca Weekly, vice president, general manager and senior principal engineer\n</p><p>\n<b>Title: CoWin: 1.3 Billion Lives Safer </b>(<b>Session: AIM327-S)</b>\n</p><p>\nTechnology has proven to be a game-changer in helping overcome the COVID-19 crisis. The CoWin vaccination platform in India supports possibly the largest vaccination drive in mankind, protecting Indians by providing easy and democratized access to vaccines. In this session, learn how the platform at its peak scaled to more than 3.2 billion hits a day, all made possible through the scalability of the AWS Cloud and Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Hear how this project is a strong testament to the power of the collaboration of AWS, Intel, partners and customers.\n<br/><b>Intel Speaker: </b>Sandra Rivera, executive vice president and general manager, Datacenter and AI Group\n</p><p>\n<b>CONTENT HUBS</b>\n</p><p>\nThe Intel AWS \u201cCity in the Cloud\u201d features easy-to-navigate content \u201chot spots\u201d throughout, highlighting customer case studies and partner solutions across multiple verticals (education, food/retail, healthcare and others).
