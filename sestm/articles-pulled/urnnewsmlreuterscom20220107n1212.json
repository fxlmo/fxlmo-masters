Whether a drag from cash holdings or simply lower Beta, periods of above-average returns are difficult for managers, while low interest rates exacerbated last year's performance.</p><p>Mega-cap tech stocks and the S&amp;P 500 equal weight index performed roughly in line with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=.SPX\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\".SPX\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">.SPX</a> last year, he said.
