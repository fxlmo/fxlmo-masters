(AWS), an Amazon.com Inc. company (Nasdaq: AMZN), announced a multi-year partnership to build the next generation of cloud-enabled infrastructure for the world\u2019s capital markets.</p><p align=\"justify\">Beginning in 2022, Nasdaq plans to migrate its North American markets to AWS in a phased approach, starting with Nasdaq MRX, a U.S. options market. Nasdaq will use a new edge computing solution that is co-designed by Nasdaq and AWS and specifically developed for market infrastructure. This solution may also be used by other market infrastructure operators and market participants to move their trading systems to the cloud. In addition, the partnership will include opportunities to explore new ways to leverage AWS\u2019s cloud capabilities across Nasdaq\u2019s anti-financial crime, data and analytics, and market infrastructure software solutions.</p><p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis landmark partnership with AWS seeks to power a truly cloud-based market infrastructure that is more resilient, scalable, and accessible for all market participants,\u201d said <strong>Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq</strong>. \u201cFor over a decade, Nasdaq has used the elasticity and high security of AWS to deliver client-driven solutions. Our innovative, new collaboration with AWS creates a bridge to the future for our markets and represents the next major step forward in Nasdaq\u2019s cloud journey.\u201d</p><p align=\"justify\">\u201cTogether, Nasdaq and AWS will change what\u2019s possible for capital markets organizations, helping them to speed up innovation and improve business processes,\u201d said <strong>Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc</strong>. \u201cCombining Nasdaq\u2019s 50 years of expertise in pioneering technology for capital markets with the proven security, reliability, and resilience of the world\u2019s leading cloud will help our joint customers and Nasdaq to continue to grow their businesses and seamlessly transact billions of dollars in trades per day. Our partnership will give Nasdaq a way to more easily move their core infrastructure to the cloud and innovate new services as they continue their second decade of cloud adoption.\u201d</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Building the Capital Markets Infrastructure of the Future</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">Core to Nasdaq\u2019s move to AWS will be <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VB19X5PbCgfBf6MQu4Rkj4P8bo7UJVrzocvPECsuKXvl1nyijm_rQTTIfnv2JdLsOVZjx7FnbkvQCETV76D4e9tqlPVLJxDhuAerIoQMqRY=\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Outposts</a>, which extend AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility. Nasdaq plans to incorporate AWS Outposts directly into its core network to deliver ultra-low-latency edge compute capabilities from its primary data center in Carteret, New Jersey. This co-designed edge computing solution would effectively establish Nasdaq\u2019s data center as the first-ever private AWS Local Zone for the capital markets industry.</p><p align=\"justify\">Over time, Nasdaq plans to move additional North American markets to the cloud with AWS. This hybrid infrastructure would provide Nasdaq with low-latency access to its on-premises systems to deliver high-frequency trading capabilities, as well as give its clients access to cloud-based capabilities, including virtual connectivity services, market analytics and machine learning, at a lower cost. Nasdaq expects this migration to the cloud to enable the adoption of new services and products in a manner that unlocks value and provides its clients with added flexibility.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Advancing Cloud-enabled Market Technology Solutions for the Global Economy </strong></p><p align=\"justify\">For the 130+ market infrastructure clients \u2013 spanning exchanges, banks, clearing houses, central securities depositories and regulators \u2013 that rely upon Nasdaq for their core trading, clearing, settlement, and surveillance technology today, Nasdaq plans to partner with AWS to develop viable cloud choices that include public-cloud and hybrid models.\u00a0</p><p align=\"justify\">Nasdaq also intends to leverage its cloud journey for its own markets, coupled with the growing number of AWS Local Zones around the world, and the collective technology portfolios of the partnership, to create a migration blueprint for its market technology clients using a combination of public cloud and edge compute options.</p><p align=\"justify\">Nasdaq expects that migrating to the cloud will give its market infrastructure clients added agility and help them rapidly adjust to ever-changing industry dynamics in their countries and regions.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Nasdaq\u2019s Cloud Strategy: A Decades-long Journey for an Interconnected Future</strong></p><p align=\"justify\">For 50 years, Nasdaq has reimagined markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. After pioneering electronic markets half a century ago, Nasdaq developed the highest performance messaging protocols in the early 2000s, which now serve as the de-facto industry standard for ultra-low latency trading. In addition, Nasdaq was one of the first exchange operators to commercialize its technology, and started using AWS technology in 2008. Today, Nasdaq\u2019s technology solutions drive high performance, transparency, efficiency, and integrity across the transaction lifecycle at market infrastructure operators\u2014exchanges, central counterparty clearing houses, central securities depositories, and regulators\u2014in over 50 countries.</p><p align=\"justify\">As Nasdaq looks to redefine the market technology of the future and tackle the transformation of its core infrastructure for the decades ahead, it is committed to creating an interconnected future \u2013 one that is safer and stronger for everyone, in the cloud.</p><p align=\"justify\">To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bmrB1YhqpLlXfy97GiWRRyoPFUOxzClJM8OAv-Pnc1Ly131kufiJwEmfnEb6HL77nJaPmCPzjt4atkzIqCS9jHwT55PTjgMA1BALxZmbS_I=\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.nasdaq.com/cloud</a>.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>NOTE TO EDITORS</strong></p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Carteret Data Center: </strong>Nasdaq\u2019s primary data center for its U.S. Equities and Options Markets is located in the Equinix NY11 facility in Carteret, NJ.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Edge Computing: </strong>Edge computing moves data storage, processing, and analysis closer to endpoints where data is generated to deliver near-real-time responsiveness for high-performance applications. <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vGAd_6yyNKNVFHkZ1OyWFw59hL-XqBZIadayxxx4hgPbh_lmfr6V5u5esILGmZGPiZzHoMUhANraNe3vHSpB4CyurR3clzcVzMBQLXoXMIFR-vqZ7wCYikvfuexMpvUg\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS\u2019s managed edge hardware and services</a> extend secure edge computing capabilities to customer endpoints, allowing them to deploy APIs and tools outside of AWS data centers in metro areas, 5G networks, on-premises locations, and on ruggedized devices.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Financial Terms: </strong>Nasdaq expects expenses and investments associated with this partnership to be consistent with our existing capital allocation framework and non-GAAP operating expense guidance, while supporting growth opportunities over the long-term.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Nasdaq MRX: </strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Lo7bjSyviq3Psv2bZYAgVcstxgXSFcgGrw6pCcG5_dqvj3xEgHR0H5EYrw7-B5M3NUlMMT98H2OAx40zRqu30iNtHHM2GCjXIXAWVk3nw9Y=\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Nasdaq MRX</a> is one of six U.S. options markets operated by Nasdaq.
