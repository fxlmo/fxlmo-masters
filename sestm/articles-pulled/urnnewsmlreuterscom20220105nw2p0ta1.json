(Graphic: Business Wire)</p></div><p>\nStellantis will accelerate its shift to becoming a sustainable mobility tech company through this relationship, which involves Amazon Devices, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Amazon Last Mile. Stellantis and Amazon will collaborate to deploy Amazon\u2019s technology and software expertise across Stellantis\u2019 organization, including vehicle development, building connected in-vehicle experiences, and training the next generation of automotive software engineers. Together, the two companies will create a suite of software-based products and services that seamlessly integrate with customers\u2019 digital lives and add value over time through regular over-the-air (OTA) software updates.\n</p><p>\n\"Over the past two decades, Amazon has built the technology, expertise, and culture of innovation to be a world leader in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We\u2019ve used these capabilities to make life better for customers around the world through products and services like Alexa, Kindle, and Fire TV, and with AWS we\u2019ve helped thousands of companies transform themselves and their industries. We\u2019re excited to collaborate with Stellantis to transform the automotive industry and re-invent the in-vehicle experience,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. \u201cWe are inventing solutions that will help enable Stellantis to accelerate connected and personalized in-vehicle experiences, so that every moment in motion can be smart, safe, and tailored to each occupant. Together, we will create the foundation for Stellantis to transform from a traditional automaker into a global leader in software-driven development and engineering.\"\n</p><p>\n\u201cWorking together with Amazon is an integral part of our capability building roadmap, based on both developing internal competencies and decisive collaborations with tech leaders, and it will bring significant expertise to one of our key technology platforms, STLA SmartCockpit,\u201d said Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis. \u201cBy leveraging artificial intelligence and cloud solutions, we will transform our vehicles into personalized living spaces and enhance the overall customer experience, making our vehicles the most wanted, most captivating place to be, even when not driving.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThe collaboration brings together Amazon's leadership and innovation in digital experiences, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with Stellantis\u2019 automotive engineering excellence and portfolio of 14 iconic vehicle brands. Stellantis outlined its software strategy during its <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stellantis.com%2Fen%2Finvestors%2Fevents%2Fsw-day-2021&amp;esheet=52558217&amp;newsitemid=20220105005609&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Software+Day&amp;index=3&amp;md5=157557aa283d699939c04a52a7ff469a\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Software Day</a> program in December 2021.\n</p><p>\nThe collaboration will focus on several areas.\n</p><p>\n<b>STLA SmartCockpit\n<br/></b>Amazon and Stellantis will collaborate to deliver software for STLA SmartCockpit, which will run in millions of Stellantis vehicles globally starting in 2024. The software-defined platform will seamlessly integrate with customers\u2019 digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences through AI-enhanced applications for entertainment, Alexa-enabled voice assistance, navigation, vehicle maintenance, ecommerce marketplaces, and payment services.\n</p><p>\nThe STLA SmartCockpit platform will use Amazon products and solutions that are purpose-built for vehicles, and Stellantis will have the flexibility to create custom, brand- and vehicle-specific capabilities. The software will offer curated services and experiences through an app store\u2014all displayed through an intelligent, adaptive user interface design that presents timely, relevant information and features suited to each occupant\u2019s individual needs and preferences.\n</p><p>\nSTLA SmartCockpit will adapt to customers\u2019 behaviors and interests, wherever their passions take them\u2013from the start of a journey at home, on the road, or off. For example, Chrysler Pacifica vehicles could offer a family-trip planner that recommends media content, points of interest, restaurants, and other fun stops along the route. Jeep\u00ae vehicles could come with a digital off-road \u201ccoach\u201d to help customers calibrate the vehicle and optimize performance before tackling tough terrain.\n</p><p>\nIntegration with Amazon's leading smart home and security services will allow customers to proactively monitor and manage their homes while on the go. Stellantis customers will also be able to manage their vehicles from their Alexa-enabled devices at home or their Alexa smartphone app, including using custom Alexa skills to set the in-cabin temperature before getting into their vehicle, schedule service, or order accessories.\n</p><p>\nThe development work on STLA SmartCockpit will leverage <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stellantis.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Frecent-events%2Fmobile_drive_joint_venture&amp;esheet=52558217&amp;newsitemid=20220105005609&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Mobile+Drive%2C+the+joint+venture+formed+by+Stellantis+and+Foxconn&amp;index=4&amp;md5=f04aee0278c678fee6438ffac4fb9b62\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Mobile Drive, the joint venture formed by Stellantis and Foxconn</a> in 2021, to develop breakthrough digital cockpits and personalized connected services.\n</p><p>\n<b>Collaborative Engineering and Innovation\n<br/></b>As part of this multi-year engagement, Stellantis has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms.
