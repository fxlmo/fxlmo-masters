It also ordered them to end the restrictions and give resellers access in a \"non-discriminatory manner.\"</p><p>Both Apple and Amazon said they would appeal.</p><p>\"The proposed fine is disproportionate and unjustified,\" Amazon said. \"We reject the ICA's suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success.\"</p><p>Apple said it respects the Italian Competition Authority \"but believe we have done nothing wrong.\"</p><p>Teaming up with selected resellers helps customer safety because it ensures products are genuine, Apple said.</p><p>\"Non-genuine products deliver an inferior experience and can often be dangerous,\" Apple said. \"To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.\"</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Associated Press.
