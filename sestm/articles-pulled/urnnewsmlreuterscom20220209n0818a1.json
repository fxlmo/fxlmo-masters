This announcement does not constitute a prospectus or a prospectus equivalent document. abrdn Shareholders are advised to read carefully the formal documentation in relation to the Acquisition once it has been despatched. Any response to the proposals should be made only on the basis of the information in the formal documentation to follow.</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"cr\">Overseas jurisdictions</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable requirements.

Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of abrdn and interactive investor about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and the events discussed herein may not occur.</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on abrdn and interactive investor or the Enlarged Group (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts.

Although abrdn and interactive investor believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, abrdn and interactive investor can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.</span></p>\n<p class=\"cs\"><span class=\"cp\">By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they are based on information available at the time they are made, including current expectations and assumptions, and relate to future events and/or depend on circumstances which may be or are beyond the abrdn Group's control, including among other things: UK domestic and global political, economic and business conditions (such as the UK's exit from the EU); market related risks such as fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, and the performance of financial markets generally; the impact of inflation and deflation; the impact of competition; the timing, impact and other uncertainties associated with future acquisitions, disposals or combinations undertaken by abrdn or its affiliates and/or within relevant industries; the value of and earnings from the abrdn Group's strategic investments and ongoing commercial relationships; default by counterparties; information technology or data security breaches (including the abrdn Group being subject to cyberattacks); operational information technology risks, including the abrdn Group's operations being highly dependent on its information technology systems (both internal and outsourced); natural or man made catastrophic events; the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; climate change and a transition to a low carbon economy (including the risk that</span><span class=\"ba\">\u00a0</span><span class=\"cp\">the abrdn Group may not achieve its targets); exposure to third party risks including as a result of outsourcing; the failure to attract or retain necessary key personnel; the policies and actions of regulatory authorities; and the impact of changes in capital, solvency or accounting standards, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which abrdn and its affiliates operate.</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">Neither abrdn and interactive investor, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither abrdn nor interactive investor is under any obligation, and abrdn and interactive investor expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"cr\">No profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements</span></p>\n<p class=\"ct\"><span class=\"cu\">No statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified financial benefits statement for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for the Enlarged Group, abrdn and/or interactive investor for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share of abrdn or interactive investor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"cv\"><span class=\"cw\">Rounding</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">Certain figures included in this announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments. </span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"cr\">Currency</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this document, to \"\u00a3\" are to the lawful currency of the United Kingdom. abrdn prepares its financial statements in pounds sterling.</span></p>\n<p class=\"cq\"><span class=\"cr\">Disclaimer</span></p>\n<p class=\"co\"><span class=\"cp\">J.P.
