From reduced costs to increased performance, the cloud provides the foundation your business needs to deliver results.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        But, how can you tell if you're getting the most from your cloud infrastructure?\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        If you're working in the Amazon Cloud, the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS well-architected framework</a> could be the solution. The framework covers <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">five core pillars</a>, all of which work to improve your cloud environment.

But it can be tricky to optimise costs when you don't know where to look.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        So, how does AWS well-architected framework help?\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The answer is simple. The AWS well-architected framework optimises costs by not only cutting out infrastructure management costs, but right-sizing virtual instances to your actual usage levels, too. Or, in other words, you <strong>only pay for the computing capacity you need.</strong></p>\n                <p>\n        On top of this, the framework allows you to <a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">track your usage</a>, analyse your workload performances, and attribute your expenditure accordingly.\n      </p>\n                <h4>\n        Unshackle your software - drive business growth\n      </h4>\n                <p>\n        Currently, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises&amp;oldid=416727\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">42 percent</a> of UK businesses use the cloud to help drive growth.
