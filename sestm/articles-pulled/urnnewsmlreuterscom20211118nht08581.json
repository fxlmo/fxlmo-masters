The Madhya Pradesh Police claimed to have busted the interstate gang. \"There are no guidelines for online businesses but Madhya Pradesh will make one. Amazon was called but they are not cooperating. I appeal to Amazon's MD-CEO to cooperate. Else, we will initiate action,\" the home minister said.</p><p>According to reports, the racket might have smuggled marijuana through Amazon claiming them to be curry leaves.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p>\"A company registered in 2007 as an Ahmedabad-based textile firm, Babu Tex Private Limited, which used to sell Marijuana as stevia dry leaves.
