The pandemic has underlined how critical telecoms are to the countries in which we operate, and throughout the crisis we have maintained our services as well as supporting communities, including by coordinating medical relief with respective governments.

Like any other business, we are increasingly exposed to the risk that third parties or malicious insiders may\u00a0attempt to use cyber-crime techniques, including distributed denial of service attacks, to disrupt the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems.

Our operating costs are subject to supply chain risks including fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, energy costs (such as diesel and electricity), and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licences, spectrum and other regulatory requirements. Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control also contribute to this risk.

Our ability to execute our business strategies depends in large part on the efforts of our key people. In some of the countries in which we operate, there's a shortage of skilled telecommunications professionals. Any failure to successfully recruit, train, integrate, retain and motivate key skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, the results of\u00a0our operations, financial condition and prospects. </span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Mitigation</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">1. Defined functional and leadership development plans for the leadership and critical roles within Airtel Africa</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">2. Ongoing identification of high potential employees for talent development</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">3.

Our financial reporting is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in internal or external conditions, new accounting requirements, or delays or inaccuracies in reporting. We continue to implement internal risk management and reporting procedures at Group and OpCo levels to protect against risks of internal control weaknesses and inadequate control over financial reporting. </span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Mitigation</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">1. Ongoing review and strengthening of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting and compliance processes</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">2.

Our telecommunications networks are subject to risks of technical failures, aging infrastructure, human error, wilful acts of destruction or natural disasters. This can include equipment failures, energy or fuel shortages, software errors, damage to fibres, lack of redundancy plans and inadequate disaster recovery plans. </span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Mitigation</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">1. Implementing geographically redundant disaster recovery sites for our networks and IT infrastructure across our OpCos</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">2. </span><span class=\"bf\">\u00a0</span><span class=\"bw\">Regular testing of fallback plans for network and IT systems to ensure reliability of switch over from active to redundant nodes in the event of a disaster</span></p>\n<p class=\"du\"><span class=\"bo\">FINANCIAL RISK</span></p>\n<p class=\"dt\"><span class=\"bv\">Exchange rate fluctuation</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Link to strategy</span></p>\n<p class=\"ap\"><span class=\"bm\">Win with data </span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Risk owner</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">Chief financial officer</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Description</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">Our multinational footprint means we're\u00a0constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where we operate. We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, in some of our markets, triggered by broader macroeconomic conditions, we are faced with instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This constrains the ability to fully benefit at the Group level from the strong cash generation of those few OpCos.</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Mitigation</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">1. Renegotiating Forex denominated contracts to local currency contracts</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">2. Hedging foreign currency denominated payables and loans, and matching assets and liabilities, where possible</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">3. Availability of adequate funding arrangements to mitigate any short-term liquidity constraints caused by fluctuations in Forex supply within our OpCos</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">4. Geographical diversification allows us to continue to access liquidity broadly across our footprint</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"dx\"><span class=\"be\">GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE RISKS</span></p>\n<p class=\"dt\"><span class=\"bv\">Compliance to legal requirements</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Risk owner</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">Chief legal officer</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">Chief regulatory officer</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Description</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">We operate in diverse legal and regulatory environments both in terms of the countries, where we operate, and the regulators for the\u00a0services we provide.

We are required to comply with Know Your Customer, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions, data privacy, quality of service and other laws and regulations. A failure to comply could lead to\u00a0unanticipated regulatory penalties and sanctions or tax levies, as well as damage to\u00a0our reputation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"at\"><span class=\"bt\">Mitigation</span></p>\n<p class=\"aq\"><span class=\"bq\">1.
