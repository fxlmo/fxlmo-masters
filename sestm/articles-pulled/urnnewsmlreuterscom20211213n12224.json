geopolitics somewhat calmer and more predictable, with much of the focus shifting from international politics to fundamental economic issues including inflation, monetary policy dilemmas, supply-chain disruptions, and the pandemic.</p><p>But that doesn't mean geopolitical tensions have gone away, says Philippe Dauba-Pantanacce, global geopolitical strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.</p><p>Top of the list for 2022 remains the relationship between China and the U.S. and other Western powers and allies, which has \"evolved from a commercial confrontation into a broader adversarial relationship where disagreements are managed rather than resolved\", said Dauba-Pantanacce. </p><p>And then there are some persistent idiosyncratic risks, which in some cases, are rising with Turkey, Russia and Latin America all on the radar.</p><p>\"Russia's regular confrontations with the U.S. and Europe are likely to continue to act as a destabilizing force,\" Dauba-Pantanacce predicts.</p><p>Europe\u2019s energy crisis this autumn gave Russia's President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to demonstrate Russia's importance on the global stage and provided a wake up call of the need for the region to diversify energy sources.</p><p>\"This, combined with the migrant crisis on the EU-Belarus border and the Russian military build-up on the Ukraine border, has increased the

29 through December 9, showed business sentiment turning pessimistic for the first time since the height of the pandemic.</p><p>\"Our December flash survey finds that 61% of businesses have become more negative about global economic growth prospects over the past month,\" writes Jamie Thompson, OE's head of macro scenarios. \"Concerns over the risks posed by supply-chain disruption and the new Omicron virus variant are evident throughout the latest survey.\"</p><p>As to when the current not-so-transitory wave of consumer price inflation will peak, the majority of the survey participants see it happening in the first quarter (36%) or second quarter (26%) of 2022.</p><p>For a breakdown of inflation expectations, please see the graphic below, courtesy of OE:</p><p><br/></p><p><div
