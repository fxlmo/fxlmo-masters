Electrification is critical to achieving net zero, but it is limited in terms of timelines, technology, and infrastructure.</li>\n<li>The Middle East is investing in upgrading infrastructure for electrification. Electricity consumption in the region is expected to at least double over the next 20 years, driven largely by desalination, urbanisation, and digitalisation.</li>\n<li>For deep-sea-going vessels, hydrogen fuel is not an option currently as it takes up too much cargo space. Maersk is looking instead at liquid fuels like green methanol.</li>\n<li>Large industrial companies not only need to decarbonise their operations but also need to align their supply chains with their own decarbonisation objectives.</li>\n<li>Digitalisation and the need to harvest and analyse huge amounts of data in the industrial sector is a major driver of increased demand for electricity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Salman Abdulla, Executive Vice President \u2013 HSSEQ, Emirates Global Aluminium</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, there is a lot of stigma and concern around the safety of nuclear power and the parties involved in that space need to have much stronger advocacy groups to educate people on its safety and security. Because it\u2019s an important fuel if we want to truly decarbonise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCommercial organisations have to look at fuel through three lenses. It has to have a secure supply, it has to be safe, and it has to be economically viable.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Caspar Herzberg, Chief Revenue Officer, AVEVA</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cMany of our clients are in the energy industry, which is under tremendous pressure to demonstrate sustainability commitments not just with initiatives but with data. At the heart of all of that is the data from your assets and you can only access that data if you\u2019re digitised.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Strandesen, Head of Future Fuels, Maersk</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learnt from evaluating future fuels is that we can decarbonise faster than we originally thought in 2018, when we set out the goal of decarbonising our fleet by 2050. We planned to launch the world\u2019s first carbon neutral container vessel in 2030 but it will now be in 2023 followed a year later by eight more vessels.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>J\u00fcrgen Petersiem, Senior Manager \u2013 Sustainability Services, PwC</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no silver bullet to green energy sources because the world is complex. You need diversification. And we will still need a green molecule in the future as electricity for example cannot power a transatlantic commercial flight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing I wish for is we see all these commitments and enthusiasm around decarbonising industry translate to overall global emissions reduction, because in the end, that\u2019s what counts.\u201d</p>\n<p>-Ends-</p>\n<div><b><span>Send us your press releases to</span>\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">pressrelease.zawya@refinitiv.com</a></b></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"footnote-disclaimer\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
