To put herself through school, Iliana worked the overnight shift at Amazon's facility in <span class=\"xn-location\">Kyle, Texas</span>.</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, on <span class=\"xn-chron\">January 3, 2022</span>, while returning to Amazon's facility from her break, Iliana was struck and run off the road by an Amazon box truck driven by <span class=\"xn-person\">Jordan Michael Sannicola</span>. The violent crash caused Iliana's vehicle to rollover and Iliana was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.</p>\n<p>After crashing into Iliana and running her off the road, Sannicola simply continued driving\u2014failing to stop and render aid as required by law.\u00a0 To make matters worse, it is believed that Sannicola thereafter exited the freeway, turned around, and drove by the scene of the crash a second time without stopping.\u00a0 Sannicola was later identified, arrested, and charged with Accident Involving Death (a second-degree felony).</p>\n<p>It is believed that Amazon hired Sannicola through one of its Amazon Relay Partners, however the lawsuit alleges that Amazon failed to conduct an adequate background check on its contract drivers, such as Sannicola, as evidenced by the fact that Sannicola had multiple outstanding felony warrants: (a) one count of Evading Arrest in a Vehicle; and (b) two counts of Abandoning/Endangering a Child. Records show that prior to the crash, Sannicola had also entered no contest pleas to criminal charges of (a) Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon\u00a0(second degree felony); and (b) Possession of Marijuana (misdemeanor).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"This horrific tragedy could have been avoided,\" stated Attorney Hilliard. \"Had Amazon done its job by properly vetting its drivers, a young woman's life could have been spared. The failure of Amazon to take necessary measures, such as performing a detailed background check on all its drivers, puts us all in harm's way. There's simply no justification for Amazon's lax protocols.\"</p>\n<p>The case is Dimitrula Velez, Individually and on Behalf of the Estate of <span class=\"xn-person\">Iliana Arie Velez</span>, Deceased vs. Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon.com Services, LLC, Amazon Logistics, Inc., Take Flight With B Trucking Company, LLC, and <span class=\"xn-person\">Jordan Michael Sannicola</span>; Case Number D-1-GN-22-000664; in the 345<sup>th</sup> Judicial District of <span class=\"xn-location\">Travis County, Texas</span>.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3446148-1&amp;h=3213516737&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hmglawfirm.com%2F&amp;a=About+HMG\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">About HMG</a><br/></b>Hilliard Martinez Gonzales LLP (HMG) has been successfully representing clients in\u00a0the United States\u00a0and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0since 1986.
