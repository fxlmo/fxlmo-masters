Dreame has announced a launch period from November 22\u2013November 30, 2021.</p>\n<p>Combining mopping and vacuuming functions, W10 easily cleans dirt, dust, wet messes, and dried-on dirt. Picking up debris, cleaning up grime, or mopping up spills are tasks handled with ease by a single automatic cleaning robot.</p>\n<p>With 2-in-1 vacuuming and mopping functions in addition to multiple cleaning modes to clean carpets and hard floors, the Dreame W10 Robot Vacuum and Mop ensures that wet messes, dry dirt, grime, and dried on stains can be effectively dealt with via automatic cleaning. W10 automatically returns to the charging base to clean the mops before returning to the spot it left off to continue vacuuming and mopping. </p>\n<p>Separate 4L water tanks, one for clean water and one for dirty water, ensure floors are always mopped with clean water while prolonging cleaning time. concludes, the mops are automatically cleaned and then dried with hot air so they are always clean and fresh for the next cleaning session.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a high-capacity battery provides up to 300m\u00b2\u00a0(3,229ft\u00b2) on a single charge. After the entire home has been cleaned, the W10 returns to the base for one last cleaning that concludes with the mops being blow-dried to prevent mildew and bacteria growth. </p>\n<p>W10 also updates a map of its surroundings 12x faster than previously possible thanks to an upgraded LiDAR-based SLAM navigation system, allowing it to avoid obstacles\u00a0intelligently. It maps rooms (even in the dark), creates systematic cleaning paths, and can store up to 3 different floor plans. With this advanced navigation, and a D-shaped design that ensures remarkable edge and corner cleaning, W10 effectively cleans homes from corner to corner.</p>\n<p>By\u00a0effectively mitigating\u00a0all of these issues with self-cleaning and hot air drying, the Dreame W10 self-cleaning robot vacuum and mop will be available on Amazon Dreame with a launch campaign running from <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 22 to November 30, 2021</span><b>. </b></p>\n<div id=\"prni_dvprnejpg2470left\" style=\"WIDTH:100%;TEXT-ALIGN:left\"><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"Dreame to Offer Big Discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday\" border=\"0\" id=\"prnejpg2470left\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1693807/Dreame.jpg\" style=\"HEIGHT:200px;WIDTH:400px\" title=\"Dreame to Offer Big Discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=95a7d790-a5d1-4907-9c62-c9d7a1d29f80&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly9tbWEucHJuZXdzd2lyZS5jb20vbWVkaWEvMTY5MzgwNy9EcmVhbWUuanBn&amp;key=eca0ee98da944ecceb9a69f6d942ab80ea8e3d88aee9a8e38deb93f893c50e344a2bc9c3da1f07afa62f2af0061e52f8fc151c7d124094a629342698f1235609\"/></div></div></div><p><b>Dreame to Offer Big Discounts for Black Friday</b></p>\n<p>Dreame has announced plans for a Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale on their products.
