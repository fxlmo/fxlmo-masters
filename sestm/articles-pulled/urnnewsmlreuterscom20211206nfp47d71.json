Management will keep 8%. SRL owns a fleet of 13,000 items of traffic management equipment, which it rents to local authorities, utilities, contractors and traffic management companies from a nationwide network of depots. SRL\u2019s product range includes temporary traffic lights, adaptive detection systems, pedestrian and cyclist systems, variable messaging systems, barriers and CCTV. 3i Infrastructure said SRL is experiencing strong growth in demand driven by an increasing number of roadworks projects, resulting from greater spending on highway maintenance, utilities works and major infrastructure projects. The deal will close shortly. 3i Infrastructure is also buying the remaining 50% it does not already own in Esvagt, the service operation vessel operator for the offshore wind industry, for \u00a3268m from AMP Capital. And it is investing US$512m by mid-2022 to acquire Global Cloud Xchange (GCX), a global data communications service provider and owner of one of the world's largest private subsea fibre-optic networks.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n              <p>(Reporting by Rod Morrison)</p>\n              <p>((rod.morrison@refintiv.com; +44 204 503 3058))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
