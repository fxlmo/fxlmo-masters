This is in part because most of the digitisation efforts have been in proprietary closed systems, hindering the potential to combine and maximise the value of data.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>IBM Open Data for Industries is an open-source solution using the OSDU data foundation for the oil, gas and energy industry. IBM Open Data for Industries is fully integrated with IBM Cloud Pak for Data for easy data management, and built on Red Hat OpenShift, the industry\u2019s leading Kubernetes platform and open architecture, designed so that companies can run and operate applications universally.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>With this collaboration, customers will gain the flexibility to run OSDU Data Platform applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises while addressing data residency requirements. Combined with the expansive cloud infrastructure of AWS cloud services, this data platform can help energy companies reduce the cost, time and resources needed to leverage the data to derive insight, streamlining operations and transition to sustainable energy generation.</div>\n<div>\u201cMuch of the data needed to solve the complex energy challenges, such as superior subsurface decisions, already exists, yet is untapped. This is because one of the greatest values of that data is derived when it can be effectively combined, but usually this data is locked by data residency requirements, legacy applications or proprietary data formats,\u201d said Bill Vass, vice president, engineering, AWS. \u201cBy collaborating with IBM and leveraging Red Hat OpenShift, we will be able to offer customers a global, seamless offering with the flexibility to run on virtually any IT infrastructure and drive longer-term digital innovation.\u201d</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>The OSDU Forum is a cross-industry collaboration that provides a vendor-neutral framework for companies to develop data platforms against common energy industry standards. By working together, IBM and AWS will accelerate the value of this platform for global customers. The goal is that this combined effort will help serve the needs of energy companies today with flexibility to adapt to change amid energy transition.</div>\n<div>\u201cData is a critical asset to help fuel energy transition, yet too often energy companies must choose between running applications on-premises or in the cloud, and often each deployment uses a proprietary data format,\u201d said Manish Chawla, global managing director, energy, resources and manufacturing, IBM.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u201cThis means that rather than using all of that collective data to gather insights, augment operations and inform innovation, some of it was going unused. Our collaboration with Amazon Web Services is addressing the need to make it easier for energy customers to access their data and provides the industry with a flexible solution to meet the challenges of today, as well as more easily adapt as the industry evolves.\u201d</div>\n<div>This collaboration underscores the value of IBM and Red Hat to provide flexibility and unlock greater business value for operational data across industries.-- <strong>TradeArabia News Service</strong></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"syndigate_disclaimer\">Copyright 2021 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
