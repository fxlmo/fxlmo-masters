In fact, Veronese's model is posing as Helena, mother of the Roman emperor Constantine, who found the true cross after dreaming of its forgotten location. Veronese had form when it came to making religious themes look secular. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/22/after-200-years-the-spanish-inquistion-still-exacts-its-price\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">interrogated by the Inquisition</a> after filling a Last Supper with realistic, bacchanalian details. Here he does at least include a big cross in the sky, St Helena's attribute. But he takes the story as an opportunity to depict a woman alone, lost in thought, in this subversive, precociously modern vision. <br/> \u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-veronese-the-dream-of-saint-helena\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">National Gallery, London</a> </p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\"> Don't forget </p><p>To follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gdnartanddesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@GdnArtandDesign</a> .</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\"> Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter </p><p>If you don't already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">please sign up here</a> .</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\"> Get in Touch </p><p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href=\"mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">newsletters@theguardian.com</a> </p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2022 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated</p></div>"}
