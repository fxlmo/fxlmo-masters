(\"Lucira Health\" or \"Lucira\") (Nasdaq: LHDX), a medical technology company focusing on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits, announced that its LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT COVID-19 Test Kit, a self-administered PCR quality, single-use, at home molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19, is available for purchase by Amazon U.S.-customers.<br/></p><p>\"We are delighted that our LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT COVID-19 test kit is once again available to Amazon U.S.-customers,\" said Erik Engelson, Chief Executive Officer. \"Access to a COVID-19 test with the PCR-level accuracy and early detectability that you get from a lab test combined with the speed and simplicity of our test kit can help Americans confidently return to work or school and to get back to gathering live with family and friends this upcoming holiday season. Amazon's reach enables more people in the United States access to this innovative and unique testing solution.</p><p>The test kit, authorized for emergency use by FDA under EUA, is available over the counter (\"OTC\"), and can produce a positive result in as little as 11 minutes, or a negative result within 30 minutes. Immediately after testing, users can access a free, text based digital\u00a0LUCI PASS\u2122\u00a0verified test result on their phone for work, travel, and leisure.</p><p><strong><span>Accurate, easy to use</span></strong></p><p>The LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT COVID-19 test kit is designed to deliver PCR quality molecular accuracy in 30 minutes or less at home. Each single-use test kit contains everything needed to conduct one COVID-19 test. It was designed and tested extensively for individuals to use independently and does not require a physician's prescription or supervised assistance. There is no additional equipment such as a reader or instrument to purchase.</p><p>In clinical trials, 100% of users successfully performed the test at home in about two minutes using Lucira's easy-to-use 'swab, stir and detect' CHECK IT test kit.</p><p>Molecular tests are more sensitive than antigen tests because they amplify critical parts of the viral target. The targeted, molecular amplification that LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT and PCR tests employ makes them demonstrably more reliable than \"rapid\" antigen tests, which can miss active COVID-19 infections.</p><p>In a Community Trial setting, LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT results were compared with the Hologic Panther Fusion, considered a high-sensitivity molecular test due to its low Limit of Detection (\"LOD\"). Lucira's accuracy was 98%, detecting 385 out of 394 positive and negative samples correctly when compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion, and excluding ten samples with very low levels of virus (those with very high PCR cycle thresholds of 37.5 or greater) that possibly no longer represented active infection. Comparative positive results agreed 97% of the time among this sample, and negative results agreed 98% of the time.</p><p><strong>LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT Test Kit</strong></p><p>The LUCIRA\u2122 CHECK IT<strong>\u00a0</strong>test kit<strong>\u00a0</strong>fits in the palm of a hand, extracts genetic material from the virus and amplifies it similar to PCR lab tests. Each Lucira test kit contains everything needed to run one COVID-19 test. Users get the test device, two AA batteries, sample vial, swab and simple one-page instructions. The batteries are inserted into the device and the sample vial is placed in the test unit. The user then opens the test swab packet and rotates the swab in each nostril five times. The swab is then stirred in the sample vial, which is then gently pressed into the test unit to start the test. The \"ready\" light will blink until a \"positive\" or \"negative\" green light is illuminated within 30 minutes. Lucira also offers a free\u00a0LUCI PASS<sup>TM\u00a0</sup>digital verified test result back to a user's phone. LUCI is accessed via text and does not require downloading an app. There is also an opt-in for public health reporting for users who wish to transmit their results to the relevant public health authorities.</p><p>Lucira's identical, prescription product is also available for sale to healthcare providers at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NHU72CQHYwwkYft3lCdKv4CXm7JCbE-cThdpAUhKucaSjZg8K-qw_3IVt0YFs1mKOSjNWVCB5RT2lJaBlEO4rA==\"><strong>lucirahealth.com</strong></a></p><p><strong>About\u00a0Lucira Health</strong></p><p>Lucira is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits.
