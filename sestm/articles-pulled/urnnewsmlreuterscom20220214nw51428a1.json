Early this year, Prime Video forged the show\u2019s title treatment in molten metal, fuelling fans\u2019 insatiable appetite for this series and organically reaching an estimated 1 billion impressions worldwide within the first 24 hours.

This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s <span>The Hobbit</span> and <span>The Lord of the Rings</span> books, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and one of the greatest villains that ever flowed from Tolkien\u2019s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of N\u00famenor, to the farthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n</p><p>\nThe series is led by showrunners and executive producers J.D.
