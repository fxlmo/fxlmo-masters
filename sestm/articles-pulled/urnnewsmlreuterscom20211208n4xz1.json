The new tool supports organizations currently using \u2013 or looking to take advantage of \u2013 spot or preemptible nodes in Kubernetes clusters running across AWS, GCP, or Azure. Spot Commander determines which workloads are safe to run on spot and selects a new set of nodes to handle the split of spot-ready and non-spot-ready workloads.<br/></p><p>\u201cCloud providers offer spot and preemptible nodes at up to a 90 percent discount by utilizing their excess compute capacity,\u201d said Webb Brown, CEO and co-founder of Kubecost. \u201cThe challenge comes with ensuring you can proactively take advantage of this capacity (and realize those reduced operating costs) without hindering workload performance or availability. Kubecost Spot Commander is built to enable Kubernetes domain experts to more efficiently consider which workloads can be optimized as spot and preemptible nodes. We believe that the Kubecost recommendations delivered through Spot Commander, which include estimated savings, will motivate more infrastructure teams to start realizing significant cost reductions.\u201d</p><p><strong>Kubecost Spot Commander works by:</strong></p><ul type=\"square\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li><strong>Analyzing cluster workloads for spot-readiness: </strong>Spot Commander analyzes the workloads running on a cluster to determine spot-readiness using Kubecost\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/spot-readiness/\"><u>Spot Checklist</u></a> feature. The tool harnesses information from the Kubernetes API and heuristics to pinpoint workloads that are ready.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Suggesting optimal cluster configuration: </strong>Once spot-ready workloads have been identified, Kubecost leverages its extensive knowledge (see what information is available via its <a href=\"https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/master/allocation.md\"><u>Allocation API on GitHub</u></a>) of an organization\u2019s workload usage patterns and the node capacities and pricing of their cloud provider. With this data, Spot Commander intelligently suggests the least expensive node types and quantities to support spot-ready and non-spot-ready workloads. The tool can also calculate overall savings for adopting the new cluster configuration by calculating the current run-rate of a cluster\u2019s nodes and comparing it with the approximate run-rate of the new configuration.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Adopting the recommended configuration: </strong>To realize the estimated savings, Spot Commander updates the cluster configuration to include new spot nodes and reduce the number of on-demand nodes. Doing so ensures that only spot-ready workloads are scheduled on spot nodes.<br/></li></ul><p><strong>Additional resources:</strong></p><ul type=\"square\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li><a href=\"https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/spot-node-recommendations\"><u>Intelligently adapt Kubernetes clusters to use spot nodes</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/spot-readiness/\"><u>A guide to spot-readiness in Kubernetes</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/10/11/2311643/0/en/Kubecost-Now-Bringing-Kubernetes-Cost-Transparency-to-2000-Organizations-and-More-Than-2-Billion-in-Kubernetes-Spend.html#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%2C%20Oct.,Kubernetes%20continues%20to%20accelerate%20quickly.\"><u>Kubecost Now Bringing Kubernetes Cost Transparency to 2000+ Organizations and More Than $2 Billion in Kubernetes Spend</u></a><br/></li></ul><p><strong>About Kubecost</strong></p><p>Kubecost is an open source project launched by Stackwatch in April 2019.
