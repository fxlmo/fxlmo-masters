Meanwhile, they've weakened for consumer discretionary, communication services, financials and utilities. She adds that Growth and Value along with Secular, Cyclical and Defensives are well represented among both the leaders and laggards on this metric, \"lending support to the idea that the positioning trades feel a little messy from an earnings perspective at the moment.\"</p><p>That said, Calvasina also notes that the rate of upward EPS estimate revisions has been slightly stronger in Value than Growth, and weaker in Defensives than Cyclicals.</p><p>\"At the sector level, we prefer to look at the rate of upward revisions for both EPS and sales.
