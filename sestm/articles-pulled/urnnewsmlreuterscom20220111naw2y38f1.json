Aveva has supported EDF with 3D digital engineering solutions at its N4 nuclear plants since the 1980s.</div>\n<div>To date, Aveva\u2019s capabilities have enabled EDF to drive its sustainable nuclear vision by reducing operational work-hours and by enhancing data consistency.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>The new partnership between Aveva and EDF is expected to generate the following results:</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u2022Reduction in design work times and in engineering work times.</div>\n<div>\u2022Decrease in the need for re-work due to consistently accurate and high-quality deliverables.</div>\n<div>\u2022Faster development rate of 3D models.</div>\n<div>\u2022Greater project visibility for all project stakeholders.</div>\n<div>\u2022Greater collaboration between design and engineering teams.</div>\n<div>\u2022Extended asset lifespans and the ability to reduce CO? emissions.</div>\n<div>The new agreement will also see Aveva digital design systems implemented as the gold standard for all new EDF nuclear projects.</div>\n<div>EDF Group Executive Director (Engineering and New Nuclear Project) Xavier Ursat said: \"The Switch digital transformation program is critical to reinforce EDF\u2019s ambition of producing low-carbon electricity and achieving our carbon neutrality objective by 2050 across our portfolio.\"</div>\n<div>\"Aveva has been a trusted partner for EDF for more than 30 years, helping us to accomplish our digital transformation. Aveva understands our requirements and we trust them to enable us to accelerate our clean energy goals,\" noted Ursat.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\"This extended long-term partnership supports our engineering design and operations teams and empowers them to optimize operational performance and to exploit nuclear energy efficiently,\" he added.</div>\n<div>Aveva CEO Peter Herweck said: \"We are proud to have built a trusted partnership with EDF that serves as the foundation stone of its digital transformation vision and sustainability program. Our market-leading digital engineering design enables us to support EDF in driving their net-zero energy strategy for the benefit of end consumers throughout the world.\"</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>\"With our new agreement, Aveva will help EDF accelerate engineering collaboration, connect teams and unlock higher performance through shared contextual data and intelligence,\" he stated.</div>\n<div>\"We look forward to assisting EDF\u2019s expert engineers to cut design time, improve collaboration and accelerate efficient decision-making to develop the nuclear industry of the future,\" he added.-<strong>TradeArabia News Service</strong></div>\n<p class=\"syndigate_disclaimer\">Copyright 2022 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
