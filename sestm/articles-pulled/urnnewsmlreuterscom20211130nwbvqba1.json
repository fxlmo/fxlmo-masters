AWS AIDA Partners solutions enable domain experts without technical backgrounds to harness artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). As part of the launch, Workato has released an AI/ML Connector, which allows for seamless integrations from any data source into Amazon SageMaker, and AI/ML Accelerator, which provides packaged Recipes and reference architectures to address key AI/ML use cases like customer churn.\n</p><p>\nWorkato empowers business and information technology (IT) teams to harness the power of enterprise automation across their application stack.
