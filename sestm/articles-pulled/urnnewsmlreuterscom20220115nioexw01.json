Fortunately, our favorite air fryer, the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL, is currently selling at as much as 43% off at Amazon. Typically listed for $349.95, you can get the 4-quart fryer in black for just $199.95. In testing, we were impressed with this model's large capacity and loved that it made crispy foods (including family-size portions) without preheating. Although this air fryer doesn't have digital controls, making it harder to precisely set the temperature and cooking time, we still found it to be the most user-friendly air fryer we tested.\u00a0</p><p><span>Get the Philips Premium Airfryer XXL from $199.95 (Save $98.38 to $150)</span> </p><p><big>2.\u00a0Under $20: This top-rated streaming device</big> \u00a0</p><p>Start streaming HBO Max, Disney+ and more on your TV for less with the Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite.
