The bank will maintain a hybrid cloud between on-premises and the cloud for several years and is the first of four identified use cases, representing in aggregate more than 3PB of data, that have been highlighted by the bank.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The initial contract will be a subscription license for 500TB of data, with a view of moving to a 'commit to consume' relationship in the future as further use cases are introduced. The customer is focused on being digitally led and one of the prime reasons for migrating to AWS is to explore Machine Learning ('ML') and Artificial Intelligence ('AI').</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The customer previously tested other solutions based on static copy technologies but was faced with network bottleneck issues and the inability to manage changes in the data at source. This made LiveData Migrator an ideal fit and the platform was selected after comprehensive testing to ensure compliance with strict regulatory security requirements.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>David Richards, CEO and Co-founder of WANdisco said:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"We are excited to sign this prestigious UK banking institution whilst continuing to work closely with AWS, one of our major cloud partners. This contract signifies how our partnership with AWS continues to expand as we progress and grow our go-to-market capabilities.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"And again, we see the primary driver to the cloud, being the desire to activate data for use in ML and AI use cases. LiveData Migrator is perfectly placed to provide the solutions that enable companies to make these transitions effectively. This is because our platform enables enterprises to operate without any production system downtime or business disruption while ensuring the migration is complete and continuous.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For further information, please contact:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>WANdisco plc</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>via FTI Consulting</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>David Richards, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Erik Miller, Chief Financial Officer</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Daud Khan, VP Corporate Development</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>FTI Consulting</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>+44 (0)20 3727 1137</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Matt Dixon / Kwaku Aning / Tom Blundell</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Stifel</span>\n</span>\n<span>(Nomad and Joint Broker)</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>+44 (0)20 7710 7600</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Fred Walsh / Richard Short</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Panmure Gordon</span>\n</span>\n<span>(Joint Broker)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Erik Anderson / Alina Vaskina</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>+44 (0)20 7886 2500</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This announcement contains inside information as defined in Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation No. 596/2014 (\"MAR\") as retained as part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 as amended.
