(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for SAP to increase resilience, enhance security, and provide more significant insights across its business. The athletic performance brand completed the migration of its SAP environments to AWS earlier this year, providing the foundation for improving performance and visibility across its design, merchandising, planning, manufacturing, supply chain, and sales distribution channels. Under Armour will now integrate its SAP environments with AWS\u2019s broad and deep set of technologies, including analytics, machine learning, compute, and storage. Powered by the world\u2019s leading cloud, this modernization brings a range of AWS capabilities to fuel innovation in areas like 3D apparel and footwear design, digitally connected footwear and apparel, resource-efficient production, direct-to-consumer sales, and global wholesale distribution.\n</p><p id=\"news-body-cta\">This press release features multimedia.

As part of the migration, Under Armour moved its enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply network collaboration, global trade services, enterprise reporting (BI, BOBJ), integration (PI/PO, data services), SAP Fiori, and solution manager workloads to AWS. Following the migration, the company implemented CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, AWS\u2019s service for scalable, cost-effective business continuity for physical, virtual, and cloud servers. With this move, Under Armour can maintain optimum system performance and minimize downtime and data loss with a cross-Region disaster recovery solution that includes 65 servers replicating from one AWS Region to another.\n</p><p>\n\u201cUnder Armour set out to find the best cloud environment for its most crucial applications and achieved that with AWS.
