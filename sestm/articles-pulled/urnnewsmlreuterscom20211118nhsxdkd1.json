Rookie QB Mac Jones' ability to complete a high percentage of his passes will put pressure on Atlanta's secondary to make open-field tackles. If New England can contain RB Cordarrelle Patterson, the Falcons will struggle to move the ball.</p><p>Falcons' keys: Atlanta must stay aggressive in big moments instead of playing not to lose. The Patriots are almost certainly going to be in the game when it reaches the fourth quarter and it will be on Falcons head coach Arthur Smith to avoid getting conservative against Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Before a Week 10 debacle at Dallas, QB Matt Ryan had started to really play well in Smith's offense. If the Falcons can get off to a quick start, they'll have a great chance to win.</p><p>\u2013 Matt Urben, Falcons Wire</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright (c) 2021 Gannett</p></div>"}
