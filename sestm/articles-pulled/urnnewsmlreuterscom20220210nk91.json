Today\u2019s agreement represents IronNet\u2019s largest AWS cybersecurity deployment in this region to date.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be recognized by this visionary GCC country for our Collective Defense platform, which enables anonymized, real-time collaboration and a more proactive approach to combating cyber adversaries,\u201d said General (Ret.) Keith Alexander, Co-CEO and Founder of IronNet. \u201cEnabling public-private partnerships is a critical part of helping this country strengthen their cybersecurity posture in the face of escalating cyber threats.\u201d\n\nThe IronNet Collective Defense platform is the first automated cyber solution that delivers threat knowledge and intelligence across industries at machine speed. By leveraging advanced AI-driven NDR capabilities, it can detect and prioritize anomalous activity inside individual enterprise network environments. The platform analyzes threat detections across the community to identify broad attack patterns and provides anonymized intelligence back to all community members in real time, giving all members early insight into potential incoming attacks. This increased visibility of known and unknown cyber threats, combined with the ability to collaborate in real time, can help improve effectiveness of cyber defenders by allowing for faster triage and stronger response capabilities.\n\nGovernment entities and private organizations across the United States and around the world have already adopted IronNet\u2019s Collective Defense platform to build dedicated communities to protect national, state, and local critical infrastructure. These communities enable cyber defenders to break down traditional silos, prioritize threat alerts, share intelligence, triage threats, and pool resources against attacks that frequently target sectors of critical infrastructure simultaneously.\n\n<strong>About IronNet, Inc.\n</strong>Founded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.)
