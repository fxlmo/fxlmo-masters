Organizations across industries in Indonesia can now take advantage of the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region to lower costs, increase agility, and drive innovation.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cInfrastructure from the world\u2019s leading cloud provider plays a critical role in accelerating our digital economy,\u201d said Perry Warjiyo, Governor of Bank Indonesia, the nation\u2019s central bank. \u201cWe expect that AWS\u2019s cloud technology will help us achieve our vision and goals outlined in the Indonesia Payment Systems 2045 blueprint, fully digitalizing the nation\u2019s payment systems and integrating a multitude of stakeholders and economic activities under the guiding principles of security and data protection.\u201d\n</p><p>\nWith the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region, AWS has 84 Availability Zones across 26 geographic regions globally, with announced plans to launch 24 more Availability Zones and eight more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers\u2019 business continuity but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The launch of an AWS Region in Indonesia provides customers with even lower latency across the country and supports disaster recovery applications for business continuity.\n</p><p>\nAWS is planning to invest an estimated $5 billion (IDR$71 trillion)<span> </span>in Indonesia over the next 15 years through the new AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region, which includes capital expenditures on the construction of data centers, operational expenses related to ongoing utilities and facility costs, and purchases of goods and services from regional businesses. The investment is also estimated to sustain an average of 24,700 direct and indirect jobs annually during this time. These jobs will be part of the AWS supply chain in Indonesia, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and jobs within the broader Indonesian economy. The construction and operation of AWS infrastructure in Indonesia is also estimated to add over $10 billion (IDR$155 trillion) to Indonesia\u2019s GDP over the next 15 years.\n</p><p>\n<b>Customers and AWS Partners welcome the news of the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region</b>\n</p><p>\nCustomers in Indonesia join millions of active customers using AWS every month in over 190 countries around the world to accelerate innovation, increase agility, and drive cost savings.
