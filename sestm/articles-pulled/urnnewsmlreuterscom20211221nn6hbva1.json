The company's artificial intelligence (AI)-driven ZEDOC platform offers healthcare providers real-time health monitoring, analysis, and risk prediction by collecting health data directly from patients in the comfort of their own homes. </p>\n<p>While developing ZEDOC, The Clinician joined the <u><a href=\"https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0010h00001ffdcBAAQ/The%20Clinician\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Partner Network</a></u>\u00a0on the <u><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/partners/isv/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">AWS Independent Software Vendor</a></u>\u00a0(ISV) Partner Path. By doing so, The Clinician leveraged AWS resources and programs specifically designed to meet its business goals faster, to develop its products while adhering to strict patient-data protocols.</p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://metrosouth.health.qld.gov.au/princess-alexandra-hospital\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">The Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH)</a></u>\u00a0in <span class=\"xn-location\">Brisbane</span> uses the ZEDOC platform to monitor and act on post-chemotherapy side effects for lung cancer patients. ZEDOC sends a weekly questionnaire via an embedded link in a short messaging service (SMS), asking patients to report on 12 key chemotherapy-related symptoms following treatment. These responses help the hospital tailor patients' post-therapy medications or modify their next chemotherapy session accordingly.</p>\n<p>By using ZEDOC to capture patient responses, PAH's oncology team can analyse real-time patient outcomes and actionable information, which is presented in a single, interactive dashboard. The oncology team also receives automated, real-time alerts when any oncological emergencies are reported.</p>\n<p>Because of the improved efficiency from ZEDOC, the oncology team is able to handle increasing workloads while delivering individualised care. Furthermore, with accurate, real-time data on patient conditions, the oncology team can determine which patients can skip hospital consultations and go straight to treatment on their next visit, and who needs a doctor's review.</p>\n<p><b>About The Clinician</b></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://theclinician.com/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">The Clinician</a></u>\u00a0is a digital health leader, redefining how healthcare is measured and delivered.
