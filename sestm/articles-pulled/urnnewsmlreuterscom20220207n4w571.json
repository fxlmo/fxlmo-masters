Venugopal, V.P. Singh, and Shreesha Merla. The tribunal did not hear any arguments today given the paucity of time and adjourned the case.<br/><br/>Amazon has been locked in a long-drawn dispute with debt-ridden Future Group over the latter\u2019s plan to sell the retail, wholesale, warehousing, and logistics businesses to billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries in a deal worth $3.4 billion. <br/><br/>In 2019, Amazon had bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons, the group\u2019s gift voucher unit, which owned a 7.3% stake in Future Retail, effectively giving the U.S. company a foothold in the flagship retailer.<br/><br/>India\u2019s antitrust regulator last month suspended the deal, saying Amazon concealed information while filing for regulatory approval. Amazon had \u201csuppressed the actual scope\u201d of the deal and made \u201cfalse and incorrect statements,\u201d the Competition Commission of India said in its order.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reliance Industries in 2020 agreed to buy the retail, wholesale, warehousing, and logistics businesses of Future Group. However, the deal has been delayed due to the dispute with Amazon. <br/>   - By Siddhi Nayak; siddhi.nayak@newsrise.org; 91-22-61353307<br/>- Edited by Vipin Nair<br/>- Send Feedback to feedback@NewsRise.org<br/>- Copyright (c) 2022 NewsRise Financial Research &amp; Information Services Pvt.
