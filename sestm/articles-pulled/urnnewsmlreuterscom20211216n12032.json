But there are hurdles to overcome first,  he wrote, including developing platforms and user interfaces that are easy to use, to expand its appeal beyond a largely male, tech-savvy early-adopter set.</p><p>The technology needs to become more energy efficient, he said, noting that a single transaction using ethereum technology requires as much electricity as an average U.S. home uses in a week.  Regulators will need to find a response to a currency that is explicitly marketed as an alternative to government-issued currency.</p><p>\u201cGlobally, countries will have to balance regulation and innovation, and weigh their desire to attract the next generation of entrepreneurs against their urge for control 14 through centralized currencies,\u201d wrote Bourkoff.</p><p>LionTree was involved in several of the year\u2019s biggest media transactions, advising AT&amp;T Inc<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=T.N\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"T.N\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">T.N</a> on its proposed merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery Inc<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=DISCA.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"DISCA.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">DISCA.O</a>, guiding MGM<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=MGMYR.UL\" data-type=\"newsExpression\" data-expression=\"MGMYR.UL\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">MGMYR.UL</a>  through its planned $8.45 billion sale to Amazon.com Inc<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a>  and advising ViacomCBS on the planned sale of Simon &amp; Schuster for $2.175 billion.</p><p><br/></p><p class=\"tr-signoff\"> (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; additional reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)</p><p class=\"tr-contactinfo\">(( <a href=\"mailto:K.Li@thomsonreuters.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">K.Li@thomsonreuters.com</a> ;))</p><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.
