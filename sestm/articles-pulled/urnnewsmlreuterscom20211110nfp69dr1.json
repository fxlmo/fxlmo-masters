The final terms value the 12-year-old company at more than US$60bn in enterprise value terms.\u00a0</p>\n              <p>Rivian had already secured US$5bn of cornerstone demand at launch from a high-powered group of investors, including existing major shareholders Amazon and<strong> T. Rowe Price</strong>, as well as Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point, <strong>Blackstone</strong>, Dragoneer and Soros Fund Management.</p>\n              <p>Billed as the next Tesla, Rivian delivered its first all-electric pickup truck in September and expects to begin producing and delivering both its SUV and electric commercial delivery van by the end of the year.</p>\n              <p>The company has 55,400 pre-orders it expects to fill by the end of 2023 from its factory in Normal, Illinois. It also has an order for 100,000 delivery vans, the biggest EV order ever, from Amazon, which is also a 20% shareholder.</p>\n              <p>Rivian shares will begin trading on Nasdaq today under the ticker symbol \u201cRIVN.\u201d</p>\n              <p>(Anthony Hughes; Editing by Stephen Lacey and Jack Doran)</p>\n              <p>((anthony.hughes@refinitiv.com; (646) 552-4852))</p>\n            </span><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 Refinitiv 2021.
