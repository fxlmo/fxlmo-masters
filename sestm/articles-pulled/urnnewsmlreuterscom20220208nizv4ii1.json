May we please place them on record for the assistance of this court?\" Dewan submitted. He also informed the bench that the submissions are a seven-page note. But the bench was miffed. \"What's this? We reserved the judgment last week and now you want to submit written submissions. What if we had already prepared our judgment? If you want to delay the matter, we don't have any problem,\" it responded.</p><p>At this, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, appearing for Future Group, opposing Amazon's plea on the ground that it appeared an attempt to delay the proceedings.</p><p>\"What else are we saying?
