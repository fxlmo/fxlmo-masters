However, to ensure improved accuracy, these machine learning models must consume ever-growing amounts of training data, which causes them to become increasingly expensive to train. This dilemma can have the effect of limiting the number of machine learning models that customers are able to deploy. AWS provides the broadest and deepest choice of compute offerings for machine learning, including the EC2 P4d instances featuring NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and EC2 DL1 instances featuring Gaudi accelerators from Habana Labs. But even with the fastest accelerated instances available today, it can still be prohibitively expensive and time consuming to train ever-larger machine learning models.\n</p><p>\nTrn1 instances powered by AWS Trainium chips offer the best price performance and the fastest machine learning model training in Amazon EC2, providing up to 40% lower cost to train deep learning models compared to the latest P4d instances. Trn1 instances offer 800 Gbps EFA networking bandwidth (2x higher than the latest EC2 GPU-based instances) and integrate with Amazon FSx for Lustre high performance storage\u2014enabling customers to launch Trn1 instances with EC2 UltraClusters capability. With EC2 UltraClusters, developers can scale machine learning training to 10,000+ Trainium accelerators interconnected with petabit-scale networking, giving customers on-demand access to supercomputing-class performance to cut training time from months to days for even the largest and most complex models. Trn1 instances are available today in preview.

I3/I3en instances offer Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSD-backed instance storage optimized for low latency, high I/O performance, and throughput at a low cost. Customers appreciate the fast transaction times I3/I3en instances provide, but as they evolve their workloads to process even more complex transactions on larger data sets, they need even higher compute performance and faster access to data, without higher costs.\n</p><p>\nIm4gn/Is4gen/I4i instances are architected to maximize the storage performance of I/O-intensive workloads. Im4gn/Is4gen/I4i instances offer up to 30 TB of NVMe storage from AWS-designed AWS Nitro SSDs, delivering up to 60% lower I/O latency and 75% lower latency variability compared to previous generation I3 instances to maximize application performance. AWS Nitro SSDs are tightly integrated with the AWS Nitro System via optimizations in the storage stack, hypervisor, and hardware. Because AWS is managing both the hardware and firmware of the AWS Nitro SSDs, customers benefit from improved functionality because SSD updates are delivered more quickly compared to using commercial SSDs. Im4gn instances (available today) feature AWS Graviton2 processors and provide up to 40% better price performance and up to 44% lower cost per TB of storage compared to I3 instances. Is4gen instances (available today) also use AWS Graviton2 processors and provide up to 15% lower cost per TB of storage and up to 48% better compute performance compared to I3en instances.
