The company turned to Radware to make it easier for its team to remotely track assets, supervise access to sensitive resources, and detect suspicious activity.\"The Radware team understands that we are a dynamic company with requirements that are constantly changing,\" said Roi Amitay, head of DevInfra at Armis. \"Radware's Cloud Native Protector plays an essential role in securing our cloud environment. It helps us see our full cloud picture and focus on what matters most. Radware provides trusted products and support, making this the best solution for our company.\"Radware's solution enhances the visibility and control Armis has over its public cloud environment. It automates manual analysis and notifies Armis about any publicly exposed assets and potential cyberattacks to help the company prioritize its work.\"Cloud-native companies like Armis have unique and constantly shifting security requirements that need specialized solutions,\" said Gilad Barzilay, director of public cloud sales at Radware. \"Our Cloud Native Protector not only secures Armis' cloud workloads but also is continually assessing risks and improving visibility and governance of their cloud.\"Radware's Cloud Native Protector\u00a0is an agentless solution that provides centralized visibility and reporting for workloads and accounts on AWS and Microsoft Azure.
