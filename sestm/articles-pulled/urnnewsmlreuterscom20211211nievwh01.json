(AP) \u2014 Three people died in severe weather in Tennessee, one person died and several were injured in an apparent tornado at an Arkansas nursing home, and emergency crews in southern Illinois were responding to reports of workers trapped inside an Amazon warehouse after its roof collapsed from storm damage. At least one fatality was also reported in Missouri as severe storms, some believed to be tornadoes, swept across the Midwest and parts of the South late Friday and into Saturday morning. Fatalities were also expected in Kentucky, where several possible tornadoes were reported, officials said. In Tennessee, two storm-related fatalities were reported in Lake County in the state's northwestern corner, said Dean Flener, spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Government reports on rising inflation and the potential costs of President Joe Biden's social and environment legislation raised fresh questions Friday about the bill's fate, with both sides hoping the new numbers would influence pivotal Sen. Joe Manchin. The moderate Manchin, D-W.Va., has spent months forcing Democrats to trim the 10-year, $2 trillion package, arguing it's too expensive and at times citing growing inflation as a reason to slow work on the bill. On Friday, the Labor Department said consumer prices grew last month at an annual rate of 6.8%, the highest in 39 years. A separate report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that if many of the bill's temporary spending boosts and tax cuts were made permanent, it would add $3 trillion to the price tag.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">4 dead in US tornadoes, storms; roof collapse at Amazon</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">New inflation number feeds angst about Democrats' $2T bill</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">South African doctors see signs omicron is milder than delta</p><p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 As the omicron variant sweeps through South Africa, Dr. Unben Pillay is seeing dozens of sick patients a day. Yet he hasn't had to send anyone to the hospital. That's one of the reasons why he, along with other doctors and medical experts, suspect that the omicron version really is causing milder COVID-19 than delta, even if it seems to be spreading faster. \"They are able to manage the disease at home,\" Pillay said of his patients. \"Most have recovered within the 10 to 14-day isolation period.\" said Pillay. And that includes older patients and those with health problems that can make them more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from a coronavirus infection, he said.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Battered survivors tell of Mexico truck crash that killed 55</p><p>TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Simply counting up the human cost of the horrifying truck crash that killed 55 migrants and injured over 100 is chilling, even for those who survived the disaster on a highway in southern Mexico. About 40 of the survivors were listed with \"multiple contusions\" at local hospitals late Friday, and they were the least injured. Nearly 20 others had fractured bones, often their arms and wrists, suggesting they tried to break the force of the impact when the semi-trailer packed with smuggled migrants tipped over and smashed into a pedestrian bridge. The worst were those with brain injuries or severe internal damage, often crushed chests, abdomens or pelvises.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">National Guard helping virus-sapped states, hospitals</p><p>More U.S. states desperate to defend against COVID-19 are calling on the National Guard and other military personnel to assist virus-weary medical staffs at hospitals and other care centers. People who became sick after refusing to get vaccinated are overwhelming hospitals in certain states, especially in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. New York, meanwhile, announced a statewide indoor mask order, effective Monday and lasting five weeks through the holiday season. \"We're entering a time of uncertainty, and we could either plateau here or our cases could get out of control,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul warned Friday. In Michigan, health director Elizabeth Hertel was equally blunt: \"I want to be absolutely clear: You are risking serious illness, hospitalization and even death\" without a vaccination.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Biden will award Medal of Honor to three US soldiers</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden will award the Medal of Honor next week to three U.S. soldiers who fought in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the White House said Friday. The soldiers are Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Celiz, an Army Ranger who died after stepping between Taliban fighters and a U.S. helicopter evacuating wounded in 2018; Master Sgt. Earl Plumlee, a Special Forces soldier who fought off Taliban insurgents after massive attack in Afghanistan in 2013; and Sgt. 1st Class Alwyn Cashe, 35, who suffered fatal injuries in Iraq while rescuing fellow soldiers from a burning vehicle in 2005.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Dole's last Kansas journey honors service, political career</p><p>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Bob Dole made a final journey back to the prairie state that shaped him for memorials in his western Kansas hometown and at the Statehouse to honor the military service that left him severely wounded and the distinguished political career that followed his recovery. Honors Saturday for the late former U.S. Senate majority leader and presidential candidate will begin with a public viewing of his casket and a memorial service at a Roman Catholic church in Russell, the small town some 240 miles (386 kilometers) west of Kansas City where he grew up during the Great Depression. Dole died Sunday at the age of 98 after serving nearly 36 years in Congress and running as the GOP nominee for president in 1996.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Cuban family finds welcome, refugee status in distant Serbia</p><p>LAJKOVAC, Serbia (AP) \u2014 Belquis Gonzales and her family enjoy something close to celebrity status in a small town in Serbia, where they live after fleeing Cuba five years ago. While most emigrants from the Caribbean island go to the United States or Spanish-speaking countries, Gonzales and her husband chose Serbia \u2014 a rare country in Europe for which Cubans do not need visas - and arrived there via Russia. \"We didn't know anything about Serbia,\" Gonzales told The Associated Press at the family's home in Lajkovac, a town about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the Serbian capital, Belgrade. \"We had many doubts and many fears as well, but things have been a lot better than we had expected.\" Still struggling with the aftermath of wars and sanctions in the 1990s, Serbia is far from a promised land for people seeking to build new lives after fleeing violence, repression or poverty at home.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Stay French, or not? New Caledonia holds independence vote</p><p>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) \u2014 Voters in the South Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia are set to decide Sunday whether to break away from France, a referendum that is important for French geopolitical ambitions and is being closely watched amid growing Chinese influence in the region. But pro-independence forces are refusing to take part, accusing the French government of trying to rush through the vote. The COVID-19 crisis complicated the campaign for the referendum, the third and last such vote foreseen as part of decades of decolonization efforts. The process is aimed at settling tensions between native Kanaks seeking independence and those who want the territory to remain part of France.</p><p class=\"tr-npp-section-title\">Indian farmers end yearlong protests and return home</p><p>NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Tens of thousands of jubilant Indian farmers on Saturday cleared protest sites on the capital's outskirts and began returning home, marking an end to their year-long demonstrations against agricultural reforms that were repealed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in a rare retreat. Farmers dismantled their makeshift accommodations at multiple protest sites and started to vacate long stretches of highways ringing New Delhi where they have camped since November last year. Hundreds of them waved green and white flags and danced to celebrate their victory as they rode tractors, jeeps and cars. \"Farmers have saved the democracy.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Associated Press.
