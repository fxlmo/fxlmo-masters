The Salesforce and AWS relationship brings together a comprehensive, industry-specific media offering designed for direct-to-consumer video and live streaming services. This allows content distributors to enhance their capabilities while also helping them rapidly launch new service offerings, such as subscription packages and product bundles,\" said Christopher Dean, VP and GM, Media &amp; Entertainment &amp; Media Cloud, Salesforce. \"Together, we're providing a customizable set of scalable and easy-to-deploy content tools and AI-driven subscriber journeys to further help studios, streamers, publications, and other distributors quench consumers' thirst for personalized content.\"\n      </p>\n                <div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>\n                      <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-and-aws-deliver-offering-that-helps-content-distributors/#\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Open Image Modal</a>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>Subscription packages and recommendations based on a user's preferences and viewing patterns are captured by Salesforce and AWS</span>\n                    <br/>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h4>\n            Image Modal\n          </h4>\n                    <div>\n                      <span>Subscription packages and recommendations based on a user's preferences and viewing patterns are captured by Salesforce and AWS</span>\n                      <br/>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <h4>\n        Direct-to-consumer video subscription offering from Salesforce and AWS offers unique benefits to content distributors\n      </h4>\n                <p>\n        The global offering is powered by Salesforce Customer 360 and <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/products/media-cloud/subscriber-lifecycle-management/\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Media Cloud subscriber lifecycle management capabilities</a>, including artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled personalization, customer data and analytics, and AWS' media, data, analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities.\n      </p>\n                <p>\n        The technology streamlines how the subscriber journey is managed from registration to new service features; provides content monetization, payments, and entitlements; supports the delivery of more dynamic, targeted ads; and improves customer interactions and campaigns to reduce customer churn. The benefits to content distributors include:\n      </p>\n                <ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n                  <li>\n                    <strong>More Integrated, Personalized Experiences:</strong> Content distributors canpersonalize viewer experiences while driving new subscriber acquisition, generating incremental revenues while increasing customer loyalty, retention and support. For example, a subscription streaming service can recommend upcoming pay-per-view content, such as a professional car racing championship special for a car-loving subscriber, while integrating new content delivery models - like live streaming - on top of existing subscription services.\n        </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <strong>Increased Retention with Additional Insight into Viewer Intelligence:</strong> Content distributors can gain deeper insight into subscriber engagement with content such as clickstream actions or likes and dislikes on specific content recommendations served up to a subscriber. Access to these insights help personalize marketing campaigns to the customer, ultimately helping to convert them to longer-term subscribers. For example, if a fitness video service notices that a subscriber's engagement is beginning to fade, it can offer classes from that subscriber's favorite instructor to initiate new engagement.\n        </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <strong>Configurable Platform to Easily Support Commerce-Driven Experiences:</strong> Content distributors can easily customize the experience, such as introducing and scaling content-driven commerce experiences and targeted ad placements. For example, a brand can do product placement in a video stream, enabling the viewer to purchase that product at the same time they're watching a video.\n        </li>\n                </ul>\n                <div>\n                  <div>\n                    <span>\n                      <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-and-aws-deliver-offering-that-helps-content-distributors/#\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Open Image Modal</a>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>Customer interactions captured in Salesforce CDP help to drive personalization.
