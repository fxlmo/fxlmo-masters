The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including necessary regulatory filings and approvals, and the transfer of specified mobile money business assets and contracts into AMC BV. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Alongside the investment, the Group and Mastercard have extended commercial agreements and signed a new commercial framework which will deepen their partnerships across numerous geographies and areas including card issuance, payment gateway, payment processing, merchant acceptance and remittance solutions, amongst others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Following the announcement on 18 March 2021 of $200m investment in AMC BV by TPG's The Rise Fund, and the sale of the Group's telecommunication towers companies in Madagascar and Malawi on 23 March 2021, the Transaction is a continuation of the Group's pursuit of strategic asset monetisation and investment opportunities. As previously announced, Airtel Africa aims to continue to monetise its mobile money business with minority investments up to a total of 25% of the issued share capital of AMC BV, and to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">The proceeds from the Transaction will be used to reduce Group debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"bg\"><span class=\"ay\">Airtel Africa mobile money services</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Operating under the Airtel Money brand, Airtel Africa's mobile money services is a leading digital mobile financial services platform catering to a large addressable market in Africa (characterised by limited access to formal financial institutions with limited banking infrastructure) and includes mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals, merchant and commercial payments, benefits transfers, loans and savings, virtual credit card and international money transfers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Mobile money services are available across the Group's 14 countries of operation, however in Nigeria the Group offers Airtel Money services through a partnership with a local bank and has applied for its own mobile banking licence. It is the intention that all mobile money operations will be owned and operated by AMC BV.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">In our most recent reported results for Q3, the mobile money service segment (corresponding to all the businesses that are intended to be transferred to AMC BV) delivered a strong operational performance:</span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Generated revenue of $110m ($440m annualised), and underlying EBITDA of<br/>\n$54m ($216m annualised) at a margin of 48.7%. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Year on year revenue growth for the quarter was 41.1% in constant currency, largely driven by 29% growth in the customer base to 21.5m, and 9.7% ARPU growth.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Growth in transaction value was 53.0% to $12.8bn ($51bn annualised). </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Our mobile money business benefits from strong network effects with our core telecom business through the extensive distribution platform of kiosks and mini shops as well as dedicated Airtel Money branches supplementing our extensive agent network, to facilitate customers' assured wallet and cash.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">We have a clear strategy to continue to drive sustainable long-term growth in Airtel Money with a focus on assured float availability, distribution expansion and increased usage cases for our customers. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">In this year alone, in addition to Mastercard, we have added partnerships with Samsung, Asante, Standard Chartered Bank, MoneyGram, Mukuru and WorldRemit to expand both the range and depth of the Airtel Money offerings and to further drive customer growth and penetration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">The profits before tax in the full year ending 31 March 2020 and value of gross assets as of that date, attributable to the mobile money businesses were $143.4m and $463.2m, respectively.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bg\"><span class=\"ay\">Key elements of the Transaction</span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Agreement values Airtel Africa's mobile money business at $2.65bn on a cash and debt free basis.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">AMC BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Airtel Africa, </span><span class=\"ay\">is currently the holding company for several of Airtel Africa's mobile money operations; and is intended to own and operate the mobile money businesses across all of Airtel Africa's fourteen operating countries once the inclusion of </span><span class=\"ay\">the remaining mobile money operations under AMC BV is completed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Mastercard (through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will invest $100m through a secondary purchase of shares in AMC BV from Airtel Africa. The transaction will close in two stages. $75m will be invested at first close, once the transfer of sufficient mobile money operations and contracts into AMC BV has been completed, with $25m to be invested at second close upon further transfers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bh\"><span class=\"ap\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span class=\"aw\">Airtel Africa aims to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years. Under the terms of the Transaction, and in very limited circumstances (in the event that there is no Initial Public Offering of shares in AMC BV within four years of first close, or in the event of changes of control without Mastercard's prior approval), Mastercard would have the option, so as to provide liquidity to them, to sell its shares in AMC BV to Airtel Africa or its affiliates at fair market value (determined by a mutually agreed merchant bank using an agreed internationally accepted valuation methodology). The option is subject to a minimum price equal to the consideration paid by Mastercard for its investment (less the value of all distributions and any proceeds of sale of its shares, and with no time value of money or minimum built in) and a maximum number of shares in AMC BV such that the consideration does not exceed $200m.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">The Transaction is expected to reach first close over next three to four months. From first close, Mastercard will be entitled to certain customary information and minority protection rights. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bg\"><span class=\"ay\">Raghunath Mandava, CEO of Airtel Africa, commented:</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">\"With today's announcement we are pleased to welcome Mastercard as an investor in our mobile money business, joining The Rise Fund which we announced two weeks ago. This is a continuation of our strategy to increase the minority shareholding in our mobile money business with the further intention to list this business within four years. We are significantly strengthening our existing strategic relationship with Mastercard to help us both realise the full potential\u00a0from the substantial opportunity to improve financial inclusion across our countries of operation. The combination of our extensive customer base and distribution platforms and Mastercard's products and services, innovation and know how, mean we can together accelerate demand and drive growth in financial services for the benefit of all our customers and markets.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"bi\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bj\"><span class=\"aw\">-ENDS-</span></p>\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">Enquiries</span></p>\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bk\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">Airtel Africa - Investor Relations</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">Pier Falcione</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">Morten Singleton</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span><span class=\"aw\"><a href=\"mailto:Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com</a></span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"g\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"g\"><span class=\"aw\">+44 7446 858 280 </span></p>\n<p class=\"g\"><span class=\"aw\">+44 7464 830 011</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">+44 207 493 9315</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"bb\">\u00a0</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"bb\">\u00a0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"bb\"><span class=\"aw\">Hudson Sandler</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">Nick Lyon</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">Bertie Berger</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span><span class=\"aw\"><a href=\"mailto:airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com</a></span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"al\" style=\"width:286\">\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"aw\">+44 207 796 4133</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p class=\"bl\"><span class=\"ay\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bm\"><span class=\"ay\">The person responsible for making this announcement is Simon O'Hara, Group Company Secretary.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bl\"><span class=\"ay\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"bl\"><span class=\"ay\">About Airtel Africa (LSE: AAF)</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Airtel Africa is a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, with a presence in 14 countries in Africa, primarily in East Africa and Central and West Africa.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">Airtel Africa offers an integrated suite of telecommunications solutions to its subscribers, including mobile voice and data services as well as mobile money services, both nationally and internationally.</span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">The Group aims to continue providing a simple and intuitive customer experience through streamlined customer journeys. </span></p>\n<p class=\"bf\"><span class=\"ay\">For more information visit </span><span class=\"aw\"><a href=\"http://www.airtel.africa\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.airtel.africa</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"a\"><span class=\"bn\">\u00a0</span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;font-size:10pt\"><div>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
