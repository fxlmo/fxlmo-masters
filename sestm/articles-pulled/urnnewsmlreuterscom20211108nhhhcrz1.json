If you want to get ahead of the Black Friday shopping rush, Amazon is offering two different ways to save on one of the best music streaming services we've ever tried, with major savings on an always-welcome gift.</p></div><div class=\"tr-npp-body\"><p><span><span>Tackle your holiday shopping with deals and expert advice delivered straight to your phone.</span> Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting team at Reviewed.</span> </p><p>Through <span>January 10, 2022</span> , Prime members\u00a0who purchase select\u00a0Amazon Echo devices will get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. The streaming service normally costs Prime shoppers\u00a0$7.99 a month (or $9.99 for non-Prime\u00a0members), meaning newcomers\u00a0can save $47.94 over the six months\u00a0(non-Prime members save $59.94) for access to 75 million songs. That means if you pick up the latest Amazon\u00a0Echo speaker ($99.99), you\u00a0can also get a plethora of\u00a0songs (plus your favorite podcasts) on demand without ad interruption and can\u00a0even download your favorite tunes onto your phone to listen to offline.\u00a0</p><p>If they're not in the market for an Echo device, Prime customers\u00a0can also get access to Amazon Music Unlimited and the\u00a0Showtime Prime Video channel for\u00a099 cents\u00a0a month for three months. Access to Showtime usually runs Prime members $10.99 a month, but now you can get that plus the millions of songs available with Amazon Music Unlimited for just $2.97 over 90 days. That's a total savings of $53.97 for access to the hottest hit songs and hit TV shows at the same time.\u00a0After the trial period, the service will renew at the normal monthly rate, so if you don't want to pay for continued access, make sure you cancel before the promotional period expires.</p><p>Whatever deal you pick, you'll be getting one of our favorite music streaming services. On top of its vast song selection, we were impressed with Amazon Music Unlimited's Dolby Atmos Music feature, which expands a song's mix selection for heightened surround and speaker height elements. Anyone with a mobile device compatible with the Amazon Music app and any pair of headphones, along with certain speakers (including the Reviewed-approved\u00a0$199.99\u00a0Echo Studio)\u00a0can use that feature for a\u00a0deeper listening experience.\u00a0</p><p>With the Showtime Prime channel, subscribers can get hundreds of movies and TV shows on-demand through the Prime Video app. This includes cinematic classics like\u00a0 <span>The Godfather</span> \u00a0to new hit shows like\u00a0 <span>Dexter: New Blood</span> .\u00a0</p><p>Whether you want to add to your home music experience or get some new media to watch from your couch, you can save big this holiday season through Amazon Music Unlimited.
