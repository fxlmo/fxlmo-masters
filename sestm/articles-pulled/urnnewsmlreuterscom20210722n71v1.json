Our investment portfolios in Private Equity and Infrastructure are well positioned for another year of good progress. Action's impressive performance continues, and the group is trading very well now that all stores have fully reopened. We are working on<br/>\n       a number of investment and realisation opportunities across the investment teams, but we remain highly selective when deploying new capital in the current environment.'\n    </p><h4>\n      Private Equity\n    </h4><p><strong>Portfolio performance and valuation at 30 June 2021</strong></p><p>\n      The Private Equity portfolio generated a strong return for the quarter, including a marked step-up in Action's performance. Sales of \u20ac1,688 million in the quarter were up 31% from Q1 2021, while EBITDA increased by 151% over the same period. At the start of 2021, Action was impacted by widespread store closures and restrictions. However, the business executed an impressive trading recovery through the end of its Q1 2021 and in Q2 2021. Like-for-like ('LFL') sales comparisons between 2020 and 2021 are difficult due to differing store closures and restrictions over the two periods. However, June (P6) is the one period with all stores substantially open in both years: P6, 2020 delivered 11% LFL growth; P6, 2021 delivered 14.7% LFL growth. Action opened 63 new stores in the quarter and continues to target c.300 new stores in 2021. Cash flow has been strong with the group's cash balance now over \u20ac700 million.\n    </p><p>\n      At 30 June 2021, Action was valued using the last twelve months' ('LTM') run-rate earnings to 30 June 2021 (\u20ac783 million) and an unchanged multiple of 18.5x net of the liquidity discount, resulting in a valuation of \u00a35,512 million (31 March 2021: \u00a34,566 million) for 3i's 52.7% equity stake.\n    </p><p>\n      The remainder of the Private Equity portfolio generated good returns in the quarter, with good momentum across most of our top 20 assets. Our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from a number of structural growth trends which have continued to support strong performance in a number of our investments, and particularly in assets operating in markets such as biologics (SaniSure), e-commerce (Luqom and GartenHaus), or with exposure to the value-for-money theme (Royal Sanders, Hans Anders). BoConcept and Q Holding are also trading significantly ahead of last year. Of our top 20 portfolio companies, 94% by value grew their LTM adjusted earnings to March 2021.\n    </p><p><strong>Private Equity investments and realisations</strong></p><p>\n      In April 2021, Luqom funded and completed the bolt-on acquisition of Lampemesteren, an online retailer of premium lighting products in the Nordic region.\n    </p><p>\n      In June 2021, we received proceeds of \u00a384 million, of which \u00a34 million was recognised as income, from the refinancing of Royal Sanders.\n    </p><h4>\n      Infrastructure\n    </h4><p>\n      3iN's share price was stable in the three months to 30 June 2021 closing at 298 pence (31 March 2021: 296 pence), valuing 3i's 30% stake at \u00a3801 million (31 March 2021: \u00a3797 million). We also recognised dividend income of \u00a313 million from 3iN in the quarter. In the period, 3iN completed the acquisition of a 60% stake in DNS:NET, an independent telecommunications provider in Germany for \u20ac182 million, and Joulz, one of 3iN's existing portfolio companies, completed the acquisition of Zonel Energy, a provider of solar rooftop solutions to businesses across the Netherlands.\n    </p><p><strong>Scandlines</strong></p><p>\n      Scandlines continued to be impacted by travel restrictions in the three months to 30 June 2021. However, freight continued to perform strongly with volumes ahead of the prior year YTD. Leisure volumes started to pick up towards the end of the period. Our core DCF valuation assumptions remain consistent with the March 2021 valuation.\n    </p><h4>\n      Top 10 investments by value at 30 June 2021\n    </h4><div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Valuation<br/>\n             basis</strong></td><td><p><strong>Valuation<br/>\n               currency</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Valuation<br/>\n               Mar-21<br/>\n               \u00a3m</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Valuation<br/>\n               Jun-21<br/>\n               \u00a3m</strong></p></td><td><strong>Activity in the quarter</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Action</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              4,566\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              5,512\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>3iN</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Quoted\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              GBP\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              797\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              801\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Cirtec Medical</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              USD\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              444\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              450\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Scandlines</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              DCF\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              435\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              449\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Tato</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              GBP\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              368\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              386\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Luqom</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              307\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              359\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              Completed the bolt-on acquisition of Lampemesteren in April 2021.\n            </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Royal Sanders</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              364\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              291\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              Returned \u00a384 million of proceeds to 3i.\n            </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Evernex</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              281\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              278\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Hans Anders</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              262\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              270\n            </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>WP</strong></p></td><td><p>\n              Earnings\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              EUR\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              259\n            </p></td><td><p>\n              263\n            </p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>\n      The 10 investments in this table comprise 78% (31 March 2021: 78%) of the total Proprietary Capital portfolio value of \u00a311,558 million (31 March 2021: \u00a310,408 million).\n    </p><h4>\n      Total return and NAV position\n    </h4><p>\n      We recognised a net gain on foreign exchange of \u00a347 million in the quarter, as sterling weakened against the euro.
