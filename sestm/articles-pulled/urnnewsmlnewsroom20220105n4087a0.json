Under the terms of the transaction, Airtel Africa's subsidiary in Tanzania will continue to develop, maintain and operate its equipment on the towers under separate lease arrangements, largely made in local currencies, with the Purchaser.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With first closing, approximately $159m of the proceeds for the transaction has now been paid, with the balance payable in instalments upon the completion of the transfer of remaining towers to the Purchaser. Around $60m from the proceeds will be used to invest in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania and for distribution to the Government of Tanzania, as per the settlement described in the Airtel Africa IPO Prospectus document published in June 2019. The balance of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt at Group level.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>-ENDS-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Enquiries</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<div class=\"story-table-container\"><table class=\"story-basic-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Airtel Africa - Investor Relations</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pier Falcione</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morten Singleton</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<a href=\"mailto:Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">Investor.relations@africa.airtel.com</a>\n</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>+44 7446 858 280</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>+44 7464 830 011</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>+44 207 493 9315</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>Hudson Sandler</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nick Lyon</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bertie Berger</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<a href=\"mailto:airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com\" data-type=\"email\" translate=\"no\">airtelafrica@hudsonsandler.com</a>\n</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>\n<span>+44 207 796 4133</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>About Airtel Africa</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Airtel Africa is a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, with a presence in 14 countries in Africa, primarily in East Africa and Central and West Africa.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Airtel Africa offers an integrated suite of telecommunications solutions to its subscribers, including mobile voice and data services as well as mobile money services both nationally and internationally.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Group aims to continue providing a simple and intuitive customer experience through streamlined customer journeys.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<a href=\"http://www.airtel.africa\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">www.airtel.africa</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n</span></p>\n<p>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
