Two of the biggest challenges facing application modernization and migration teams today center around how to efficiently decompose monolithic applications into microservices and how to safely stage, migrate, and deploy those microservice applications onto cloud environments. By using the vFunction platform, developers and architects are able to lower the risk of these projects by automating and accelerating the refactoring and re-architecting of their legacy Java applications into microservices and deploying them on to AWS cloud-native infrastructure.</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
