For the entire 12-month period, Amazon stock has risen by a modest 5.8%. Since mid-July, the stock has dropped by 9.5%. While the e-commerce giant is expected to post solid revenue growth in the third quarter, rising costs for labor are expected to weigh on operating profits. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the company's revenue last year. This year is following a different narrative.When 49 of 49 analysts give a stock a Buy or Strong Buy rating, that stock may be a good one. That's what analysts think of Amazon stock. At a recent price of around $3,397, the upside potential based on a median price target of $4,150 is 22.5%. At the high price target of $5,000, the upside potential is 47%.</p><p>Analysts are looking for third-quarter revenue of $111.66 billion, which would be down about 1.3% sequentially but up 16% year over year.

Amazon is the fourth-most valuable, trailing Apply by about $720 billion. Not counting Apple or Amazon, there are only four other companies worth more than that $720 billion difference: Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Tesla.</p><p>Is it any surprise, then, that governments around the world are seeking to rein in the power of the tech giants? And Apple gets a lot of attention because it is the biggest. That attention may be Apple's strongest headwind\u2013that, and the same supply chain issues that plague every other maker of a product that has a physical manifestation. Still, Apple stock is up nearly 31% over the past 12 months, although it's down more than 4.5% since early last month.</p><p>While not as bullish on Apple as they are on Amazon, of 43 analysts covering Apple, 33 give the stock a rating of Buy or Strong Buy.
