Intel's latest Xeon Scalable processor includes the HE acceleration layer\u00a0HeXL, which\u00a0utilizes Intel Advanced Vector Extensions that accelerate AI workloads and come equipped with hardware-enhanced security capabilities. This is the first time that such capabilities are available at scale for large data sets and for a variety of ML models - a major step for the adoption of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies.The collaboration between Duality and Intel enables accelerated privacy-enhanced ML workloads on AWS, allowing enterprises to apply Data Science and ML computations on their sensitive data in the cloud, while the data remains encrypted at all times, even during analysis.\u00a0This new capability\u00a0also ensures that organizations processing sensitive data in the cloud remain compliant with data privacy regulations - as they are never directly exposed to the data being processed.Earlier this year, Duality and Intel\u00a0teamed up\u00a0to deliver optimized data science and AI applications for privacy-enhanced data collaboration. The collaboration focused on accelerating ML applications with HE on the new 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors.\"Duality and Intel are working together to allow organizations across the\u00a0globe to benefit from secure, AI-powered data collaboration at scale, enabling a whole new world of big data insights and privacy-protected collaboration across industries,\" said Dr.\u00a0Alon Kaufman, CEO and Co-Founder, Duality Technologies. \"We are excited to bolster our relationship with Intel and allow AWS customers to use the cloud for ML workloads on sensitive data, removing a long-standing roadblock to utilizing the cloud within regulated industries.\u00a0We invite enterprise customers and their ecosystem to experience this new offering in\u00a0our Sandbox.\"Founded by world-renowned cryptographers and data scientists, Duality has harnessed its foremost expertise in Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and data science to develop the Duality SecurePlus\u00ae suite of secure data collaboration applications, addressing the specific business needs of organizations that seek to collaborate on sensitive data while protecting their business interests and complying with data privacy regulations. Duality SecurePlus\u00ae applications enable such collaboration on protected data and AI models by keeping them encrypted throughout computation. The collaborating parties can run computations securely in any environment - whether their own, their partners', or on a third-party cloud - without exposing sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).The Intel Homomorphic Encryption (HE) toolkit, recently released as an open source project and available at the\u00a0Intel Developer Zone, is the prime vehicle for the continuous delivery of this\u00a0Intel HE technological innovation to users. The\u00a0toolkit\u00a0has been designed with usability in mind to make it easier to evaluate and deploy HE\u00a0technology on Intel platforms.\"At Intel, we believe that security and privacy are critical to today's data-driven economy,\" said\u00a0Nir Peled, general manager of Private AI and Analytics at Intel. \"Privacy-enhancing Homomorphic Encryption, now available at scale on AWS, will fundamentally change how data is shared and leveraged by organizations worldwide. We look forward to continuing working with Duality to make privacy, data confidentiality\u00a0and\u00a0data utility achievable goals for all enterprises.\"</p></div><p class=\"line-break\"><br/></p><p class=\"tr-copyright\">Copyright \u00a9 2001 MarketLine.
