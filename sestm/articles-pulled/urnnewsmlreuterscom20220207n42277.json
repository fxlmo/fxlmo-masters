Peloton Interactive <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=PTON.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"PTON.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">PTON.O</a> shares surged as much as 29% on Monday after Reuters reported <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2UF2UY\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2UF2UY\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> that Amazon.com <a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/Verb=FullQuote/ric=AMZN.O\" data-type=\"ric\" data-ric=\"AMZN.O\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">AMZN.O</a> could buy the beleaguered workout firm. The two companies aren\u2019t an obvious match, but there\u2019s potentially value in selling Peloton\u2019s high-octane workouts to Amazon\u2019s massive user base. Doing so could significantly beef up Peloton\u2019s value.</p><p>Peloton\u2019s business model is in flux <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2U13I5\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2U13I5\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span>] after a surge in bike sales during 2020 and 2021 came to a halt, and the company experienced a backup in its warehouses. The company\u2019s operations consumed $561 million more cash than they made in the last-reported quarter. Chief Executive John Foley <span> (<a href=\"reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N2SN3BT\" data-type=\"storyId\" data-story-id=\"nL4N2SN3BT\" translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\" class=\"tr-pnac\">Full Story</a>)</span> has said the environment is only getting harder. </p><p>Amazon might not be an expert at making connected exercise bikes, but it could offer customer growth on steroids. Andy Jassy\u2019s firm has more than 200 million Prime members, compared to the 3 million who plug into Peloton. Its users already pay monthly for movies, books, and rapid retail gratification. Amazon could layer on Peloton\u2019s products while trimming its marketing and sales budget, which ate up almost a quarter of its $3.1 billion in sales last year. </p><p>Say Amazon can sell more of Peloton\u2019s digital subscriptions, which go for $12.99 monthly. That\u2019s less than the $39 paid by those who also take Peloton\u2019s bikes and treadmills. But digital customers don\u2019t come with high costs, which makes that business scalable. Overall subscriptions have gross profit margins of around 62% while the gross profit for Peloton\u2019s connected fitness products is around 29%. </p><p>If 10 million Amazon subscribers took a Peloton subscription, with a 50% margin, it would bring Foley\u2019s firm an extra $800 million a year in pre-tax profit. Halving sales and marketing costs adds on another $365 million. Taxed and capitalized, it\u2019s equivalent to $8 billion of value, double Peloton\u2019s market capitalization based on Friday\u2019s close. In fitness lingo, that\u2019s probably the fastest way to bulk up.</p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thereallsl\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">@thereallsl</a> on Twitter</p><p><br/></p><p>CONTEXT NEWS</p><p>- Peloton Interactive has received interest from potential buyers including Amazon.com, according to a Reuters report on Feb. 4 citing a person familiar with the matter.
