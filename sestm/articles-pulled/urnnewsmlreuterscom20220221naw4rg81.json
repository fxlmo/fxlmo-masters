We look forward to sharing how our expanded portfolio, including the integration of the industry leading PI System, can fuel data-centric growth in the age of performance.</p>\n<p>\u201cData has become the backbone of business operations over the pandemic.

Sharing those innovations with other stakeholders in the connected industrial economy elevates achievements across the board, transforming economic growth and delivering sustainable value on every level,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p><strong>Data-Led Innovation in Real Life</strong></p>\n<p>Delegates at AVEVA PI World 2022 will see how data inspires leading enterprises and thinkers to transform disruption into opportunity \u2013 and gain a close understanding of how human insight remains essential to unlocking data dividends and furthering automation gains.</p>\n<p>\u201cData has become central to industrial innovation and is now being collected in greater quantities than ever before. Yet, without human insight to direct and apply that information, the benefits of digital transformation remain limited,\u201d said Michael Dean, Global Director \u2013 Power, Controls &amp; Information Systems, Kellogg\u2019s. In a keynote at AVEVA PI World 2022, Dean will outline the role of human ingenuity in the data-driven organization of the future.</p>\n<p>Damien O\u2019Connor, Chief Technology Officer, Cognizant \u2013 TQS, and an AVEVA PI World 2022 panelist, added: \u201cData has the capacity to drive innovation, realize sustainability goals and accelerate the fourth industrial revolution.
