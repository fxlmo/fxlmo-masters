The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Rights Issue. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, the Underwriters will only procure investors who meet the selling restrictions including the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. </span></p>\n<p class=\"mh\"><span class=\"lf\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"mh\"><span class=\"lf\">For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Rights Issue Shares, the Nil Paid Rights and the Fully Paid Rights.</span></p>\n<p class=\"mh\"><span class=\"lf\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"mh\"><span class=\"lf\">Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own Target Market Assessment in respect of the Rights Issue Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;font-size:10pt\"><div>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
