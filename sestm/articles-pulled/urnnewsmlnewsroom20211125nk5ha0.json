(ASX/TSX: PRU) (\"Perseus\") is a 500,000oz per year gold producer that operates three mines in <span>West Africa</span> . Confirmed by their announcement today (See <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3428696-1&amp;h=572331166&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwcsecure.weblink.com.au%2Fpdf%2FPRU%2F02480454.pdf&amp;a=+Perseus+Release\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">Perseus Release</a> for details), Perseus has purchased a 15% shareholding interest in Orca from Resolute Mining Limited (\"RSG\"). In addition to this purchase, Perseus has also agreed to provide Orca with a <span>US$5 million</span> short-term loan facility, which will mature on <span>June 30, 2022</span> with interest charged at a rate of 7.5% per annum. The proceeds from the loan will be used as working capital and for continued exploration and development activities at Block 14. This strategic share acquisition and loan facility positions Perseus to complete its evaluation of <span>Sudan</span> and the Block 14 Gold Project towards a possible transaction to acquire the balance of the outstanding securities of Orca.</p>\n<p>On <span>January 16, 2022</span> , the first civilian flight, operated by Blue Bird Aviation in <span>Khartoum</span> , successfully landed on Block 14's <span>1,700m</span> airstrip, located 8km from the development camp and primary resource, Galat Sufar South (GSS). The passengers on the flight included senior management from Orca and senior government representatives from the Ministry of Minerals. The establishment of the airstrip shortens the journey from <span>Khartoum</span> to Block 14 from two days by car to two hours by plane.</p>\n<p>Phase I of Block 14's 100-man development camp is near completion and will be ready for move-in in a few weeks. At the same time, a 7km fencing around the project's resources is ongoing and is scheduled for completion in Q2 2022.</p>\n<p>Block 14 is one of the leading gold development projects in <span>Africa</span> , with an average projected production rate of almost 230,000 ounces of gold per annum for the first seven years and an all-in sustaining cash cost of less than <span>$800</span> per ounce (See Company news release on <span>September 14, 2020</span> ).</p>\n<p>\"On behalf of the Board and our team at Orca, we welcome Perseus as a shareholder. We are happy that <span>Sudan's</span> potential is being recognized by a multi-mine African gold producer. While there is no assurance that a larger transaction will transpire, we are confident that should it proceed, the Block 14 project and our investment in Montage Gold Corp. will add significant value to Perseus' project and development portfolio. A potential combination would also better position Block 14 for continued development and achieving production for the benefit of the people of <span>Sudan</span> .\" commented <span>Richard Clark</span> , President and CEO of Orca Gold Inc. \"I also want to extend our sincere gratitude to his Excellency, the Honourable Minister of Minerals, <span>Mohamed Bashir Abu Numo</span> , for his continued support in our efforts to advance Block 14 to the next stage and for his advocacy of foreign investment in <span>Sudan's</span> prolific resource potential.\"</p>\n<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors,</p>\n<p>\"Richard P.
