To truly understand what this future will look like, we need to be curious about the changing world around us. It requires an inclusive culture, where diverse perspectives drive our actions.\n          </p>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <p>\n            Evidence continues to show how a commitment to diversity and inclusion contributes to fairer and more effective businesses - more balanced decisions, greater innovation, better client outcomes. We know that the impact of this also extends to the role we play as a responsible investor and in the communities we are part of.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            The impact of the pandemic has made this all the more significant. For many of us, the way we live and work has changed beyond recognition since the onset of COVID-19. There are also many existing social inequalities that have been highlighted and compounded. Movements for change including Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have been profoundly felt and have generated important global conversations.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            We are constantly looking for ways to go further: to make sure that our people can be at their best; to shape new and better ways of working; and to contribute to wider industry and social change. The targets and pledges we have for improving workforce diversity reflect our ongoing commitment and will help us build on our progress.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            I'm proud of what we're already achieving together. We set our first ethnicity target in November 2020 and, after reaching our previous gender representation targets ahead of schedule, our new ones will challenge us to do more. My leadership team are driving action plans across our regions and functions. And when it comes to measuring progress against our peers, I'm pleased to say that we've had some real successes\n          </p>\n                    <ul class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\">\n                      <li>\n                        <span>a third consecutive year in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index; named by Citywire as having the highest percentage of female fund managers in companies of our size; and recognition by Equileap as a global leader for employer</span>\n                        <span>\u2011</span>sponsored parent leave.\n            </li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <p>\n            There is still more to do.

   We aim to enable our clients to be better investors. By investing responsibly, and making a positive impact through our operations, it helps create a better future for all. A commitment to diversity and inclusion is vital to understanding the needs of all of our stakeholders.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            What we say must be what we do. This means embedding this commitment through talent processes, our brand, the suppliers and partners we choose, and the way we engage with the companies we invest in.\n          </p>\n                  </div>\n                  <div>\n                    <p>\n            Inclusive ways of working\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            The pandemic has brought the way we work front and centre, and has shown that diverse ways of working don't hinder productivity. But careful consideration is needed to make sure people feel connected and involved.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            The flexible working journey we were on helped us to make the rapid transition needed to respond to the pandemic.

It's equally important that people see diversity in all forms thriving here.\n          </p>\n                    <p>\n            This means being honest about where we are now and where we need to do better - and encouraging conversation about it.
