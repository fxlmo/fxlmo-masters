This means there may be greater divergence among the two countries' metaverse ecosystems related to major players, content creation, infrastructure outlays, applications, product formats, laws and regulations, and investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>Despite the differences, there will be some familiar trends. American companies are once more the front-runners exploring the cutting edge of the metaverse's possibilities. Chinese companies, meanwhile, are attentively looking westward for affirmative evidence that can be adopted for the massive Chinese market.</p>\n<p>It seems certain that in the metaverse revolution, the US and <span class=\"xn-location\">China</span> will again play to their respective strengths.\u00a0But the geopolitical tensions will complicate the evolution of \"the next chapter of the Internet\", presenting companies with more complicated business decisions that go far beyond commercial considerations. </p>\n<p>\"It feels quite like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when you see how ByteDance, <span class=\"xn-money\">Tencent</span>, and Baidu launch their products or make investments taking cues from Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft,\" says <span class=\"xn-person\">Nina Xiang</span>. \"At the same time, <span class=\"xn-location\">China's</span> reliance on foreign core technology is again likely to define and constrain the country's metaverse build-up. Conversely, American companies are consciously reevaluating their supply chains by incorporating the '<span class=\"xn-location\">China</span> risk' factor.\" \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The book examines the entire metavese ecosystem to highlight the differences and shared characteristics of the development in the U.S. and <span class=\"xn-location\">China</span>. From major companies and their metaverse development strategies; metaverse infrastructure (chips, data centers, cloud services); man-machine interfaces (XR, AI); applications; and product matrixes, a comparative analysis of the two tech superpowers' next computing transformation will give readers unparalleled understanding of humanity's technology future.</p>\n<p>Other countries and regions including <span class=\"xn-location\">South Korea</span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Japan</span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Southeast Asia</span>, and <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe</span> will also be covered to contrast the two tech superpowers' blueprints. </p>\n<p>This book will provide readers a comprehensive and deep dive into how the metaverse will be generated and built around the world. Readers will therefore be better equipped to find the best development strategy or growth opportunities for their own businesses or organizations in the age of the metaverse.</p>\n<p>The book is currently on pre-sale in e-book format here: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RN764WF\" data-type=\"url\" class=\"tr-link\" translate=\"no\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RN764WF</a></p>\n<p>The e-book will be released on <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 3, 2022</span> while a paperback format will be available at the same time.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>About <span class=\"xn-person\">Nina Xiang</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Nina Xiang</span> is a renowned author and award-winning journalist, and an expert on the Chinese venture capital and technology sector with nearly twenty years of financial and business media experience.
