% The document class supplies options to control rendering of some standard
% features in the result.  The goal is for uniform style, so some attention 
% to detail is *vital* with all fields.  Each field (i.e., text inside the
% curly braces below, so the MEng text inside {MEng} for instance) should 
% take into account the following:
%
% - author name       should be formatted as "FirstName LastName"
%   (not "Initial LastName" for example),
% - supervisor name   should be formatted as "Title FirstName LastName"
%   (where Title is "Dr." or "Prof." for example),
% - degree programme  should be "BSc", "MEng", "MSci", "MSc" or "PhD",
% - dissertation title should be correctly capitalised (plus you can have
%   an optional sub-title if appropriate, or leave this field blank),
% - dissertation type should be formatted as one of the following:
%   * for the MEng degree programme either "enterprise" or "research" to
%     reflect the stream,
%   * for the MSc  degree programme "$X/Y/Z$" for a project deemed to be
%     X%, Y% and Z% of type I, II and III.
% - year              should be formatted as a 4-digit year of submission
%   (so 2014 rather than the academic year, say 2013/14 say).

% =============================================================================

% This section simply introduces the structural guidelines.  It can clearly
% be deleted (or commented out) if you use the file as a template for your
% own dissertation: everything following it is in the correct order to use 
% as is.

% \section*{Prelude}
% \thispagestyle{empty}

% A typical dissertation will be structured according to (somewhat) standard 
% sections, described in what follows.  However, it is hard and perhaps even 
% counter-productive to generalise: the goal is {\em not} to be prescriptive, 
% but simply to act as a guideline.  In particular, each page count given is
% important but {\em not} absolute: their aim is simply to highlight that a 
% clear, concise description is better than a rambling alternative that makes
% it hard to separate important content and facts from trivia.

% % You can use this document as a \LaTeX-based~\cite{latexbook1,latexbook2} 
% template for your own dissertation by simply deleting extraneous sections
% and content; keep in mind that the associated {\tt Makefile} could be of
% use. %, in particular because it automatically executes \mbox{\BibTeX} to 
% deal with the associated bibliography. 
% Alternatively, upload this template, dissertation.bib, dissertation.cls, 
% dtklogos.sty and the "logo" folder to Overleaf (an online \LaTeX editor and compiler) and work on your thesis there.

% \textbf{Do not include this section in your final dissertation --- just delete it from the source.}

% =============================================================================

% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
% title and so on).

\maketitle

% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.

\frontmatter


%\lstlistoflistings

% The following sections are part of the front matter, but are not generated
% automatically by LaTeX; the use of \chapter* means they are not numbered.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Abstract}

{\bf A compulsory section, of at most 300 words} 
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
and main contributions (e.g., deliverables) and achievements; the same 
section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
topic, {\em and} what your view of the outcome is.

The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
chapter. If your project is experimental in nature, this should include 
a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
for each project, but an example might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than 
the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
time.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The latter aspects should (ideally) be presented as a concise, factual 
bullet point list.  Again the points will differ for each project, but 
an might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the 
      Java garbage-collection sub-system. 
\item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux 
      device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is 
      used to control it.
\item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping 
      from A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
\item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by Jones and 
      Smith in [6], see page $12$, corrected a mistake in it, and 
      compared the results with several alternatives.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}

% {\bf A compulsory section}
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% It is common practice (although totally optional) to acknowledge any
% third-party advice, contribution or influence you have found useful
% during your work.   include support from friends or family, 
% the input of your Supervisor and/or Advisor, external organisations 
% or persons who  have supplied resources of some kind (e.g., funding, 
% advice or time), and so on.

I am very fortunate to work with my superviser Rami Chehab, who assisted in my research greatly and inspired the vast quantity of this project. He has been a great mentor.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for always being there for me, especially when the going gets rough. You guys really helped make this university experience what it was.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


% \chapter*{COVID-19 Statement}

% {\bf An optional section, of at most 800 words} 
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% A summary of any planned research activities disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions and the extent to which it was possible to adapt the work in those changed circumstances. If the project was able to go forward as planned, you can safely remove this section without losing any marks. The following may be included:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Details of any planned research activities curtailed by the pandemic because of, for example, lack of access to facilities, libraries, archives, research participants, fieldwork, etc. Information on any curtailed training should be included only insofar as it relates to the impact on research activities and on the dissertation.

% \item An acknowledgement of the anticipated contribution and value to the dissertation if those research activities had not been curtailed and what was possible to include in the dissertation in the circumstances, including where alternative choices were made to adapt the work and whether there are any weaknesses that could not be overcome.

% \item Any other relevant factors on the impact of Covid-19 on research activities and on the contents of the dissertation.

% \item Details of any research activities required by the examiners as part of a resubmission that were curtailed by the pandemic may be included in a new or revised Covid-19 statement in the resubmitted dissertation.
% \end{itemize}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl



% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures and tables.  These are all compulsory parts of the dissertation.

\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



\chapter*{Ethics Statement}

{\bf A compulsory section} 
\vspace{1cm} 

In almost every project, this will be one of the following statements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``This project did not require ethical review, as determined by my supervisor, [fill in name]''; or
        \item ``This project fits within the scope of ethics application 0026, as reviewed by my supervisor, [fill in name]''; or
        \item ``An ethics application for this project was reviewed and approved by the faculty research ethics committee as application [fill in number]''.
    \end{itemize}
    
See Section 3.2 of the unit Handbook for more information. If something went wrong and none of those three statements apply, then you should instead explain what happened.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \chapter*{Summary of Changes}

% {\bf A conditional section} 
% \vspace{1cm} 

% If and only if the dissertation represents a resubmission (e.g., as the result of
% a resit), this section is compulsory: the content should summarise all
% non-trivial changes made to the initial submission.  Otherwise you can
% omit it, since a summary of this type is clearly nonsensical.

% When included, the section will ideally be used to highlight additional
% work completed, and address criticism raised in any associated feedback.
% Clearly it is difficult to give generic advice about how to do so, but
% an example might be as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% \noindent
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Feedback from the initial submission criticised the design and 
%       implementation of my genetic algorithm, stating ``there seems 
%       to have been no attention to computational complexity during the
%       design, and obvious methods of optimisation are missing within
%       the resulting implementation''.  Chapter $3$ now includes a
%       comprehensive analysis of the algorithm, in terms of both time
%       and space.  While I have not altered the algorithm itself, I
%       have included a cache mechanism (also detailed in Chapter $3$)
%       that provides a significant improvement in average run-time.
% \item I added a feature in my implementation to allow automatic rather
%       than manual selection of various parameters; the experimental
%       results in Chapter $4$ have been updated to reflect this.
% \item Questions after the presentation highlighted a range of related
%       work that I had not considered: I have make a number of updates 
%       to Chapter $2$, resolving this issue.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}

% {\bf An optional section}
% \vspace{1cm} 

% \noindent
% This section should present a detailed summary, in bullet point form, 
% of any third-party resources (e.g., hardware and software components) 
% used during the project.  Use of such resources is always perfectly 
% acceptable: the goal of this section is simply to be clear about how
% and where they are used, so that a clear assessment of your work can
% result.  The content can focus on the project topic itself (rather,
% for example, than including ``I used \mbox{\LaTeX} to prepare my 
% dissertation''); an example is as follows:

% \begin{quote}
% \noindent
% \begin{itemize}
% \item I used the Java {\tt BigInteger} class to support my implementation 
%       of RSA.
% \item I used a parts of the OpenCV computer vision library to capture 
%       images from a camera, and for various standard operations (e.g., 
%       threshold, edge detection).
% \item I used an FPGA device supplied by the Department, and altered it 
%       to support an open-source UART core obtained from 
%       \url{http://opencores.org/}.
% \item The web-interface component of my system was implemented by 
%       extending the open-source WordPress software available from
%       \url{http://wordpress.org/}.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
      \item I used a sample of headlines from Kaggle as training and validation data (\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguelaenlle/massive-stock-news-analysis-db-for-nlpbacktests})
      \item I used the Natural Language Toolkit to assist the preprocessing of data, using their English words and stop words data (\url{https://www.nltk.org/})
\end{itemize}

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.
% - The chapters are presented here in one file; this can become hard
%   to manage.  An alternative is to save the content in seprate files
%   the use \input{XXX} to import it, which acts like the #include
%   directive in C.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendicies; these are 
% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signaled as being appendicies via
% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriatly.

\appendix

% \include{appendix.tex}
\chapter{Appendix}
\label{appx}

Content which is not central to, but may enhance the dissertation can be 
included in one or more appendices; examples include, but are not limited
to

\begin{itemize}
\item lengthy mathematical proofs, numerical or graphical results which 
      are summarised in the main body,
\item sample or example calculations, 
      and
\item results of user studies or questionnaires.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that in line with most research conferences, the marking panel is not
obliged to read such appendices. The point of including them is to serve as
an additional reference if and only if the marker needs it in order to check
something in the main text. For example, the marker might check a program listing 
in an appendix if they think the description in the main dissertation is ambiguous.
